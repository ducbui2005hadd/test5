12/26/2016,0,0,445,Recommended,So this is my review for rust... I have been an avid player of Rust off and on for the past year or so and i gotta say it's one of my favorite games I've ever gotten into and I mean it. For me this game has transformed so much over the years that it comes neck and neck with the Fallout series for me at least. Development wise this game is well a game changer. At first Facepunch couldn't really decide on what was happening in the game like it was chaos and almost impossible to play because of server crashes zombie glitches and instant killing radiation (keep in mind that this was the Rust about 2 years ago). BUT. The changes Facepunch makes with Rust are for the better and the game truly gets better with every update. (Especially when they got rid of the ranking system). Another thing to add is that in Rust and the community of Rust assume everyone is a brutal warmongering There are friends to be made but you're better off with your own friend group or even solo for that matter. I've played Successfully in both forms but it is no secret that your chances of dominating a server increases when you have a friend group. The PvP in this game gets really and i mean REALLY intense. I cannot tell you how many times i've been in a fire fight when i'm out gathering resources sometimes you win and leave with more loot. But most of the time when you're farming out there people sneak up on you and then it's like open season for bandits. But like I said when you're with a group of people you dominate. Don't really know what else to say but if you're not fully convinced watch a video on it or sleep on it it's only $20 so I would just get it.Some tips If you suck at PvP join a modded server and practice Don't get used to modded servers Rust will consume your life (especially when you as a player are doing in terms of commodity) THE MORE YOU PLAY RUST THE MORE YOU TURN INTO A COLD BLOODED Trust no one KOS or hide,Rust,5,445,1928,373,5

5/6/2017,0,0,955,Recommended,I love this game. The devs have a lot of work on there hands. There are a lot of bugs. At least one of my squadmates crashes every few games. One of my friends can't even play it because the buildings don't load in for him. I can run to cover on my screen but to the enemy I am in the open for an extra second and can get shot. You can be driving a vehicle across a straight flat plain with no bumps then your car does a backflip for no reason. The car physics in general are just terrible. There are not enough different weapons yet. The weapons are not balanced the SMGs shoot nerf darts. There are much more things that need to change.This game is fun for me because I play with friends. I would recommend this game if you have friends that you would play with.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,955,764,152,5
8/2/2018,0,0,1376,Recommended,Despite it's problems it's still the most enjoyable battle royale game on the market. Fortnite isn't my thing IoN is good but it can't compare to the aesthetic of PUBG. After the countless times I've raged and uninstalled the game I still end up coming back. Maybe it's the tight gameplay how the guns feel or the adrenaline rush after getting a chicken dinner who knows. Something just keeps me coming back. I've played it since first day early access and probably will continue to do so until the game completely dies. if you like BRs where you just pick up a gun and start shooting people PUBG is for you. If you don't care about monitization schemes and just want to play the game PUBG is for you. I love the crap out of this game. You will too.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,1376,749,140,5

5/10/2017,0,0,255,Not Recommended,Game is currently bad. Hit reg is awful desyncing everywhere end game circles determine who wins. This game is currently about 80% RNG. Until they fix the end game circles (slow them down give people more time to run in which more fights and less RNG) don't bother.EDIT It's now October and there are just too many wall hackers. Really ruins the game when players know exactly where you are. Cool.EDIT Well here are are in April 2018 and the lag/hit reg issues are worse than ever. It's clear these developers have no clue how to fix this issue. Fortnite is killing this game for very good reason same exact game engine (Unreal 4) yet better hitreg and less lag. I'm not sure why PUBG won't hire some Epic devs to come over and fix the game? Or at least contract that work? Makes no sense to me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,255,795,148,1

I played like 5 matches before the ping limit update and of course the death cam is weird but at least is obvious that at least if in the death cam the killer is not looking at you or far from you it's a cheater otherwise it's a normal player.

The game is gorgeous and everything just seems fun to explore.For newcomers I woudl still very much recommend. Although MH has a notoriously hard learning curve once you figure out what your doing i have experienced few more satisifying rewarding and fun games. It's well worth figuring out the intricacies of the series. Also this game is not especially about the story and the cutscenes can be a bit cringy at times but the gameplay is the real meat of the series.So overall I think the game is great. I woudl highly recomend anyone to try it. Well worth full price in my opinion. 9.5/10Excellent game despite the people complaining in the reviews.

4/19/2015,0,0,47,Recommended,Not much has to be said about the Grand Theft Auto series as Rockstar always manages to deliver an outstanding experience.The single player campaign starts slow and somewhat lackluster but eventually builds momentum as you're introduced to more exciting personalities and missions. Some of the story elements are oddly written at times and feel a bit off enough to kill the excitement. The second half of the game is pretty on point with no real complaints. Lots of great dialogue and setpiece moments as expected. Tons of content here even if you just do the main story missions... expect 20 hours or more of gameplay just for the main story.GTA Online leaves a lot to be desired. Getting into a game with friends can be a real challenge sometimes. Starting missions and heists causes you and others to connect to a new game instance. The swapping from freeroam to missions and back causes so many loading screens that it gets really obnoxious really quickly. When you go back to freeroam there is no guarantee you're even playing with the same people you were originally. It's a real headache just trying to do a variety of things with friends. Console players are also allowed to transfer their characters over meaning you could be facing level 100+ people as a person who just started playing for the first time. The online mode should have been done differently more like how APB handles it. It's a real letdown but still can be good fun if you enjoy the sandboxing.Overall it's GTA on PC. It looks great and it runs great. Definitely worth the money.,Grand Theft Auto V,3,47,1556,271,3

Huge environments with lots of variety but if you start off at the wrong spot you may have found yourself in a walking simulator.

9/2/2018,0,0,198,Recommended,A fantastic game with a poor port but it is still worth getting.At launch there were a bunch of connection issues but the recent patch seems to have almost completely eliminated that. There are still some poor optimization issues that may lead to issues on certain machines but I have a Nvidia 1050 graphics card and can still run it at 50 60 FPS even with fairly high settings.The gameplay itself is amazing whether you are a new or returning hunter you will find that the combat has a lot of depth to master with a lot of variety with the different weapon types to boot.If you find yourself on the fence I say come on over and give it a shot. It may be the best game you play this year.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,4,198,688,132,4

The low frames are a big issuse if you want to play pubg on a 2011 gameing computer you will have no chance playing PUBG because it loads in maps But one good thing is that Blue hole is still trying to make players have more frames. If you want to have a fun gaming experinse this is not the game. Play CSGO play L4D2 but not this game I would play and have no idea where the guy is and it turns out that he is cheating long range with a SK12 I don't know how bad the battle eye system is but I heard it was pretty good but now you can play with cheaters and never no about it.If you can if these problems then the game will be so much fun playing Cheaters Frames Sound Gun play(Add) ranksI would love to play this game but it's just really bad and the gameplay is just bad for a new comer.

1/13/2018,0,0,29,Not Recommended,Bought a copy through the 'Social Club' by accident and found out instantly upon installation that it was from an outside source that controls your keys. I didn't much appreciate that but the game was still there despite not having steam achievements or integration. So I purchased it again on steam only to find that it has the same Social Club garbage plaguing it as well. Now apparently you can't share an account with another user and play at the same time despite having two copies of the damn thing so you move along to customer support and they say they can fix it but end up transferring the Steam key to another account so you're left with the initial crap version you didn't want without telling you. Then they move you to another employee later on to tell you that they could only transfer the Steam version because it was purchased last. They'll suggest you link your steam account with the user that they're transferred your key to while losing your progress (even though there is no option to) and insist they cannot do anything about it even though they're in full control of your account. It took me two weeks with short and single responses during this period to get nowhere so basically I purchased two copies for cryptic responses so I still can't use either version nor can I get a refund because of their slow responses. Being forced through an outside source is a major flaw that puts this corporation in control which I won't be doing again with any other purchases. Avoid Rockstar purchases at all costs. The story mode was terrible boring with a bunch of FMV cutscene filler. I got it for online to play with someone else but there really isn't anything to do there some 'races' that are like playing Hot Wheels for little kids point to point races run around and shoot eachother for no reason mode 'heists' that feel as though you're accomplishing nothing transform races another kid mode basically. The only part of the online experience that is eye catching is being able to drive around together which gets old really fast being that you can go into a select number of places marked on the map and the others are all like those little plastic car toysets from the '80s store fronts with stickers on the front to tell you what they are with no interior. They've really made no improvements over the last.... 5 6 years? And the game still sucks.2/10. Even their radio humor has dwindled to the point of just being annoying. This game is basically a money grab that's been going on for years push out 'new content' that isn't really new same old just to keep that price tag up to $60 and try to entice users to buy their useless money content.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,29,2669,481,1

For me this is the best Battle Royale out there. Although there is one big problem and is called ""optimization."" The point is it's an awesome game with a great potential but it's poorly optimized. The devs have been working hard to make this game better but sometimes it feels like every patch gets worse and better at the same time. So yes I reccomend this game because of how fun it is to play it and how intense it gets (winning your first chicken is a blast.)

GTA V is like the whole franchise combined its amazing how good is the voice acting the back story's of the main characters.Its not only Rockstar that makes this game amazing and really fun its the mods the people that make them sometimes some mods are even more creative that rockstar.And the community is not as mean and bad like CS GO and other games theres actually a lot of friendly people to play with. Theres a lot of things to do in freemode too making an organization buying a yacht and defending it and many other things.The game is fun but not really fun without friends because you can do much more stuff with friends and have fun when you play with randoms you're kinda more competitive and you dont see how fun the game actually is when you play with friends you dont take the jobs as serious so you have more fun.I strongly recommend this game 11/10 IGN .

Some of the servers have pretty bad connection and i find myself lagging a bit sometimes but not game breaking. I really wish i could play with my friends online who are playing it on PlayStationI usually play it when i get tired of playing CS GO or something else.

Online multiplayer has been fixed by the time of this review but I hope that graphical patches can be implemented in the future! I've been a Monster Hunter fan since 3U on the Wii U and I am impressed with World's visuals content and combat! While definitely different than previous entries its another Monster Hunter game that feel satisfying to play and fun to play with friends.Controls work well with either a controller or KB/M! To back this claim up my controller died mid battle and I was forced to use my keyboard and mouse. After a couple minutes of adjusting I was able to complete the quest without fainting!At the time of this review console DLC content/crossovers have yet to implemented (however they have been confirmed) so I can't wait will they come to PC.

Well you won t need any of those because all you need is a good connection and a controller. Welcome to Rocket League where as a starter it will be a struggle for you to get out of lower ranks due to smurfs. You will be flexed on with high end items and use a voice chat which sounds like the voice chat from 2000 s Valve games. Not to mention that if you live in Asia you will never find a game to play and you ll have to play on NA or EU servers where the ping is higher than the population in Asia. The game itself offers a lot of opportunities and hours of entertainment. Play it with your friends or if you don t have any make some inside the game.

6/14/2017,0,0,2750,Not Recommended,"To make things clear I like gta V. Hell I nearly have 2000 hours on it making my total playtime over 2 and 1/2 months. My ""beef"" is the multiplayer and the practices of the company who made it. Online mode started out fine it added content with DLC that was managable. Anyone could get the things in it. Then the first time they said ""F**k you!"" to the fans. That was when they added the gold helicoptor for 5000000 and the gold plane for 10000000. Nobody could get that unless they hacked or paid for ingame money which is the reason they do this. For the last year and more all DLCs did was add some clothes for regular people then things that costs so much money that it's nearly impossible to get it without hacking or buying ingame money.Now with singleplayer I play singleplayer almost exclusively now due to the reasons listed above and it gets more and more obvious that Rockstar doesn't care about singleplayer. At first when DLCs came a lot of the content was added to singleplayer as well that would be the vehicles the guns and some more. For over a year now they have not added anything to singleplayer.And the lies Rockstar said before the game came out on any platform that their would be singleplayer expansions. They said it after it was released as well and they said it again after that and they keep saying it. They said that it would already be out far before now. But nothing. No singleplayer DLC because Rockstar thinks it can milk more money out of little kids stealing daddys credit card to buy ingame money then to actualy bring an expansion that the fans would pay for to play new missions of GTA V's amazing singleplayer.TLDR Unless you only want it for singleplayer or are a hacker who knows how you wont get banned or are extremely rich and you are willing to sink a f**kton of money into anything then DON'T BUY THIS GAME.If they add a good singleplayer DLC or addon then I will happily change my review.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,2750,1935,356,1

11/30/2017,0,0,577,Recommended,"Guess I should review this game... I have a love hate relationship with this game. I love it when I win get close to winning or even when I get more than 3 kills in a match. Other times I hate it because of ""Network lag detected"" hackers or simply the desync between players.The desync between players is marginal doesn't happen all the time but you'll know it when it happens. Hackers... (As I've found) are mainly on the NA servers so I just play EU and I haven't ran into a single one yet (Jinx). Network lag detected is usually server wide so all the players in the server typically experience it unless you're having serious packet loss then it'll just be you in which case you should probably find a single player game to play until you have more bandwidth to begin with.As for the love (Saving the best for last)... this game has it's ups and downs. It has emotion it has buildup it has climax and sometimes it's so anti climactic that it makes you want to pick up a bad habit. How many times I've had level 3 everything 200 rounds in my M4 and a 4x with a silencer and I get shot in the back by some jerk sitting in the blue zone. But that's part of the game it's a strategy. It's a bs one but it's a strategy. A lot of people in videos complain about campers or people hiding... what they don't realize is everyone has a playstyle. This game forces you to work outside your comfort zone it forces you to adapt to different players different situations and because of that I find my hands shaking sometimes after a tense confrontation or even in a nervous situation when I know people are around me and I have a Machete. The game has it's moments that make it great and those (to me) far outweigh the few unlucky games I've had with hackers lag and the unlucky loot spawns.The updates for the game are immaculate. A lot of people say you need a super high end computer to play this game. That's not true. Let me give you an example. I have an AMD FX8350 and an R9 290 4GB. Bad CPU pretty decent graphics card. When this game was first released I'm talking first week. I was getting maybe 20 to 40 fps in all areas of the map and lets not even talk about poly. (It was atrocious). After months of updates and optimization. I can now get upwards of 60 to 90 fps and that's with Re Shade! Which depending on your settings can drastically reduce your fps. While I don't agree with their minimum specs as the game becomes prettier and more optimized maybe you can play on ultra low settings with those specs. I wouldn't advise it if you want something playable though. Having played on the test server multiple times I can say that the updates are pretty thoroughly tested between the small community that's on the test servers before they are pushed to live although there's always those people who can find weaknesses or possible abuses in the system and that's why the game is in early access. To attribute for the ""inequality"" that may arise during updates. While I have a soft spot for these kinds of games since my days of an Amateur Counter Strike Source Semi Pro the thing that makes this game great aren't the graphics the unlucky loot drops the desync issues (obviously). It's the tension you feel EVERY SINGLE GAME. I get so into it I jump when I hear a shot from somewhere I didn't expect. 7.1 surround baby )This review is really long. The game though is worth it. Is it worth 30 dollars at it's current level? I've been playing since the game was first put out and I have 380 hours (Will be going up) At 10 dollars per 100 hours I'd say that's a pretty fair trade. So in conclusion if you don't mind the occasional bug if you have a halfway decent system compared to mine or better. If you have really cool friends who like to have fun and shoot the occasional baddie if you don't mind running hundreds of kilometers over the course of 10 games (Running sim 2017) then I think you'd enjoy this game. It's improved a drastic amount don't listen to the people hating on everything about the game pointing out all of its flaws acting like nothing has ever been fixed. If anyone has been around since the beginning you know how much the game servers and optimization has improved since first release. Have a wonderful day. )",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,577,4237,793,5

From the moment you start it has a definite minecraft feel.

Apart from that the game is glitchy buggy in many ways and instead of trying to improve those aspects they keep realising huge patches (last one was 13 gb) for skins and emojis which would be great if it didnt have major problems.Im writting these review because i didnt play for a while (after the 13 gb update) and now that is done i played 20 mins and got to crashes.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,129,700,134,1

7/12/2017,0,0,541,Not Recommended,REVIEW UPDATED APRIL 4TH 2018 Please consider this review if you wish to know the most honest review for this game from someone who has a mature ethical point of view for life. Played for over 380 hours and it took me only 25 to realize all this. My score for this game 5/10. Yes score first. Because this game is currently impossible to play. I uninstalled this game about 2 months ago.Pros Very interactive game very fun to play with friends PVP and building creativity can pump your heart with blood and adrenaline. With the naked bodies funny motion movement and the aggression of low quality players the game shows a strong sense of humor especially during PVP. You will lose yourself a lot and get laugh tears during some interactions.Cons IMPOSSIBLE TO PLAY UNLESS YOU ARE WITH A GROUP OF 5! With the addition of the new blueprints components and decay it is has become very hard to keep up as a solo player. Especially when clans of 5 20 people roam around the server destroying every fresh spawn/duo/solo they see. You can spend 40 hours farming and researching and then get demolished in 15 minutes by a clan of 10 who split hard work you just did. HACKERS! HACKERS HACKERS! Yes Facepunch doesn't seem to care about the ruined experience in games. They would rather have a couple of hackers rebuying their game due to VAC bans. Aimbot ESP file scripts flying all kinds of things are common and seen daily in almost every server in SEVERE amounts (25% of all players in an official server use some sort of a hack and try to make it less obvious on purpose with all kinds of tricks). It make take weeks for official servers to ban a hacking player. Facepunch spends their time enhancing the design aspects of the game (adding lots of useless items colors trees etc) but not the overall user experience. NO AGE/INTELLIGENCE RESTRICTION IN THIS GAME! You will find A LOT of little kids who will try to chase you with a rock and yell the dumbest and immature things into their budget microphones. If you are above 20 you will have issues losing your temper because some kids will just you off to a brand new limit. There are a lot of immature 6 14 year olds playing this game with poor logic skills who will interfere between you and the excitment of this game. There is a severe use of foul language coming most players foul language that pops out randomly in chat at a critical level literally for no reason (most think it's funny). I haven't encountered this problem even in games like Call of Duty. Little kids and some of their parents think this game is Minecraft but it's not. If you read the game description you will see VIOLENCE BLOOD GORE NUDITY and more. I've encountered TODDLERS playing this game and I am not joking when I say TODDLERS!! Bugs and graphics need to be improved and balanced. As a jr. game developer it is easy for me to tell that the game has an unbalanced rendering system. My gaming computer has a GTX 960 4GB with i7 6700K and 32GB of DDR4 and I temporarily drop down to 20 40 fps when it renders further terrain (medium high settings). This issue happens to many people I play with. I have tried a lot to try to fix the issue even reprogrammed the game and overclocked both GPU and CPU but that didn't do much with this game. I really do not want to spend another $450 for a top notch graphics card just because of the unbalanced rendering. Animations are sloppy and slow (but improving). You will find a 4 7 second delay every time you switch and prepare a different weapon. Getting you killed and ruining the pvp experience. MOST of community members in this game are very salty spicy toxic and mentally violent/ill. A lof of foul language sexual content and violent interactions between players. Something you will have hard time finding in other FPS/TPS games. But you have to consider this when you buy this game and when the game's fan base mainly consists of underaged kids and lazy puberty teens. Other than that the game WAS really fun addicting and made me stay until 5AM.I would NOT recommend this game. I hope it improves because it is hard to play this game with all those issues.,Rust,1,541,4132,752,1

7/9/2016,0,0,1712,Recommended,"Rust makes better use of voice chat than any game I've ever played. You are naked and alone on the world's silliest island. There is no narrator or announcer so instead you submerge in the quietude of the unkempt grass crunching beneath your feet as you uselessly smash your rock against the nearest pine tree. Perhaps you've also harvested some mushrooms and a few bundles of flax enough to stave off the hunger pangs and fashion yourself a burlap shawl to cover your shame. If you're particularly industrious you'll have furnished a nice wooden shack a stone's throw away from some fresh water and reliable resources the entry level homestead necessary for any successful Rust campaign.But then you hear it. Faintly at first. Carried on the tip of the breeze. It's another idiot in Rust. I don't know what it is with this game. Maybe it's the fact that you spawn unclothed and uncensored maybe it's the brutal vastness of the design or maybe it's the simple uncouth joy of doing bad things to other human beings but Rust has a distinctly regressive effect on the human species. The voice chat merges with the draw distance so when you're spotted by an idiot you'll start hearing the talk quietly tickling your ear. They get closer they get louder and more confident and suddenly you're hopping over shotgun shells while absorbing an entire dictionary of insults.No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.It's so hilariously antagonistic that I wish I could say I didn't love it. I wish I could say that it didn't feel incredible when one of those naked idiots charged me with their rock and I switched to the battle axe I fashioned out of scrap metal (which he almost certainly didn't know I was carrying) and put him down with a single well placed strike. I wish I could tell you that as I was standing over his fatally wounded body that I didn't laugh my off when my headphones were filled with the voice of a prepubescent boy shouting ""Hey man wait a second!"" I wish I could say I didn't kill him anyway. No game has ever indulged our lack of humanity quite like Rust and I wish I didn't mean that as an endorsement.If it feels like we've been living with Rust for a long time that's because we kinda have. The game was first released in Early Access in late 2013 by developers Facepunch Studios and it's been a mainstay of goofy YouTube send ups ever since. If you're somehow unfamiliar with the premise think of Rust as a dumber more nihilistic Minecraft. You wake up on a map armed with only a rock and a torch. You quickly figure out that by banging your rock on a few environmental doodads you can harvest a few basic resources (stone wood and cloth) which you can parlay into a few prehistoric instruments like a spear or a hatchet. This is similar to the scrounging mechanics in plenty of other survival games but what makes Rust different is how deep that tech tree goes. Eventually from those same basic ingredients and a few mechanical leaps of faith (like work benches and furnaces) you'll be able to craft pistols flamethrowers and rocket launchers. Rust famously does not quarter off its servers to keep entry level nakeds away from the roving troops suited up in advanced firearms which means that occasionally your journey will end with you matching another player's revolver with a rock that you've tied to a stick.This is the heart of Rust. Wake up naked run for your life do horrible things to one another. There is no grander narrative or mythos or win condition. Most of the servers are on a strict weekly or monthly reset schedule which scrubs the island of any lingering housing or fortifications left behind by the players which gives the experience a strange sense of futility. Yes you will need to manage your hunger thirst and health and as you ratchet up the tech tree you will discover increasingly effective ways to stay alive but that's it. Sure there are some areas on the map that are stricken with radiation which leads to the implication that perhaps you and the rest of your misanthropes are occupying a far flung post collapse society but those moments feel more like window dressing than anything else.I spent the vast majority of my time in Rust playing solo but I don't want to discount the notorious community of players that band together in clans and wage wars of aggression along the shared hunting grounds. One of the fascinating kernels of Rust's brutality is how everything in the world remains persistent even if you're logged off which means that smart players arm their bases with land mines punji sticks and keypad locks while they're away. (Some clans even recruit players across all time zones to make sure there's always someone on guard.) That's a coordination I appreciated from a distance. There are a number of YouTube documentarians showing off the multi man raids that spawn from committed Discord channels all over the world. Instead I engaged with the population of Rust on a purely incidental level. An extremely geared man takes pity on you and drops a crossbow at your quivering feet. That's Rust! A kid and I are raiding an abandoned gas station for food and weapons and I give him the extra pair of pants I was carrying around. When I'm turned the other direction he bashes his rock right through my skull and runs off with the rest of my stuff. That is also Rust.I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along.Given the tone it shouldn't be surprising that the community I found in Rust tended to be fairly juvenile and toxic. There's a high concentration of racism and misogyny in the global chat so much so that I eventually left the channel entirely. And unsurprisingly the new player experience is quite prickly. The development team didn't spend any time cooking up a tutorial (which makes some sense when you consider how long the game has been available). Instead when you join one of the many servers you're presented with a few faint hints in the top left corner of the screen ""harvest wood!"" ""build a hatchet!"" The crafting system itself is fairly intuitive with well written tooltips for each of the items in the catalog and you can fast track yourself into some serious munitions if you get lucky with a few resource spawns. The PvP combat won't win any awards but it's tactile and packed with wonderfully sadist bone crunching sound effects connecting your hatchet with an idiot's head feels great and really that's all I needed. There is also a strange post release monetization model in which you can buy ugly paint jobs for your weapons and clothing. Rust is fascinating for a hundred different reasons but Counter Strike style weed leaf AWPs isn't one of them. Still though I think everyone should at least have a taste of Rust. It's hard to think of many other games that are this uncompromising in its worldview and I'm utterly entranced with how little faith it has in our ability to get along. We could build a utopia on this island! We could cast aside our weapons and construct a peaceful commune where everyone is fed warm and loved. I love how Facepunch dangles that potential in front of our face with no real incentive pushing us in any direction. If we are to dehumanize ourselves and turn this Eden into a battlefield we will do it on our own terms. In Rust there is a real sense of complicitness when you eventually succumb to violence more potent than in any other survival game on the market. Despite the lack of rankings to chase or K/D to nurture or exclusive vendors to unlock despite the unassailable fact that none of this will matter as soon as the server is wiped we are at war and we always will be.",Rust,5,1712,7712,1371,5

Use TAB to free lookRun to the circle before the countdown hits 10 Just turn you voice to team onlyOk so that first part is to show you this game has a large learning curve you can't get off COD BO3 and think you can play any fps! This game is a tactical shooter it requires lots of patience practice and perseverance. You will SUCK you first few hours... so all the negative reviews calling this game too hard play the game awhile!This game is so satisfying dropping in the school killing the 3 people on the roof with nothing but a pistol jumping down collect guns 2 more kills... you clear a largely populated area and get out alive you have 5 kills 2guns on you back riding a motorcycle across a field... this game is tons of fun and will only get better at time goes on. This game is frequently updated at least 1 update per month. Tips for new players YouTube is your friend your best friend... good luck and keep it up!

This game has one of the best online and single player experiences in recent years. Even with grinding and all so sorts of pay to win ""garbage "" its still good. Sad to see the modding community is being shutdown but that doesn't mean you have to review a game negatively to make your voices heard.

8/29/2017,0,0,394,Not Recommended,I used to love this game. It ran well on my computer and was always really tense and captivating.However recently this game has skyrocketed into a burning fire of explosive death. By that I mean it got bad. Real bad.Hackers are everywhere and I always find myself being traced through a wall at long range or being instantly aimboted with absolutely no chance to defend myself.And that's not even the worst part.The servers. EVERY SINGLE KILLCAM only the first shot I take gets registered. Just recently i gunned down someone at point blank with four shots of the sk12 shotgun and the killcam revealed that only 1 had registered. But seriously. That was the last time I died.And EVERY SINGLE KILLCAM this week 90% of my shots fired haven't registered. THIS IS NOT AN EXAGGERATION. I couln't find A SINGLE KILLCAM whereas the rit registration was not broken.I know people want to region lock china to get rid of hackers but I think this is just blame coming from the awful servers this game has.Don't waste your money because your friends say the game is cool and it looks cool. Just don't. You'll only gain rage quits and eventually quit the game itself for good because it just doesn't function.P.S. as a top 2% solo FPP player don't just say I missed and it wasn't the servers. Because I would know.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,394,1301,231,1

1/31/2018,0,0,288,Not Recommended,This is how GTA V is designed. If you wish to just go killing anyone this is the game for you if you wish to try and do businesses to get money or doing jobs this game is not for you. Someone with a higher level or better buildings and equipment will always have the upper hand over you. Either using a rocket bike to shoot you with a fly by or use and Orbital cannon to destoy you while doing shipments or restocking. Thus if you a person who thrives on killing others for little to no gain you will enjoy your time playing online whereas you a person who enjoys collecting and building yourself up to enjoy the game with mates its a terrible idea.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,288,649,127,1

6/20/2017,0,0,102,Not Recommended,I bought the GTA V for Xbox 360 then Xbox one and now PC. The only reason I even had the slightest inclination to do so was for my interest in single player modding. Not a single interest to bring it in to the GTA V Online portion of the game as I am sure millions of us do. I am sorry that a few bad eggs can ruin it for everyone but those that wish to cheat online are still going to do so. It would be one thing if the Online DLC was even worth it but honestly every pack that comes out sucks. And nothing has come out for single player in years. I would not even be playing GTA V again if it wasnt for my ability to enhance the single player mode for my enjoyment.All in favor of boycotting GTA 6 say 'I'.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,102,709,148,1

5/17/2017,0,0,32,Not Recommended,The game is in very rough shape. And I mean VERY rough shape. This is early access after all so keep this in mind when you throw 30 dollars at something that may not turn out to deliver upon promises made. Performance is awful for most people with decent setups so you'll have to run at very low settings if you want to get any decent FPS. The game is shallow enough in terms of features that you'll get tired of it after about three games. It's pretty much the same routine over and over again anyway. Land find some hope you don't get shot in the back by some in the first 30 seconds hide until the circle is small enough die rinse repeat. You'll notice about one third of players die in the first 90 seconds of the game which is entirely normal since most people just fight over the same every round. Unless you're someone who is actually really into battle royale games and is also very interested in being a free labor bug tester then by all means throw your money at this game.

11/22/2018,0,0,175,Recommended,This game isn't perfect but there are lot of fun experiences to be had. Just be warned the survivors of this game will butt dance you at every turn whether or not you're even the killer. Also they tend to dish out a lot of salt...be prepared to be called a camper at every turn especially if they lose in the match. Even if you let them go even if you're spinning in circles. You're the bad guy...so just play to the point of your character if you're the killer.This game isn't the kinda game you want to play competively but for the horror aspect because no matter what something seems to always be unbalanced but that's okay the fun is in the experience here. I've had so many jumpscares and creepy moments from playing both the survivor and killer. Both modes are fun as well with both being quite challenging depending on player skill and knowledge of the game. This game will make you feel scared at least once.

However with Rust the developers have done no such thing and have been making massive improvements and have added many new things every single week ever since the game had a massive revamp. This game has many things in its future and has many things right now. If you get this game today you'll have a ton of fun (though you should really have some friends to play with that makes it 10x better).

6/16/2017,0,0,2586,Not Recommended,Story Los Santos is gorgeous and fun to just cruise around and look at. Beautiful lighting. Music is great. Great voice acting. Game runs good. Good vehicle dynamics handling and selection. Story was very unoriginal with unoriginal characters I completed 70% before I lost interest. Online MMO play style with an economy. Peer to peer netcode. No server browswer or community servers. Endless connection issues freezes and session timeouts. Matchmaking is terrible for races deathmatches etc it's very hard to find a lobby with more than 5 people. Repetitive gameplay. DLC is extremely expensive and requires lots of time grinding the same missions over and over or buying sharkcards. They released a car that was $60 in shark cards! Every update has lots of bugs. Are currently banning players for no reason and the customer support is non existent. No community engagement or communication. Not mod friendly.It can be fun to just mess around in freeroam with your friends but that gets old after awhile.I spend most of my time racing with a group of people which I do enjoy. I like the vehicle dynamics there are lots of vehicles to chose from and they all have unique handling. And vehicle mods are pretty damn solid. User created tracks are awesome. But we still have constant connection issues where the entire lobby will freeze because one person dropped for example.Even though I have 2 000+ hours in the game and there are many positives about the game there are too many negative aspects for me to recommend it universally.

Sometimes you kill them with sword sometimes a hammer a bow a gun a bow gun and sometimes with the power of music. And if that's not enough after killing them you then proceed to carve their carcass for materials so that you can wear their skins and use their dead body parts to kill more of their kind.So technically you are a ""MONSTER"" hunter.Ps.

2/21/2017,2,1,1200,Not Recommended,Before you drop your hard earned $20 on this game I will warn you ROCKET LEAGUE IS RIGGEDWhat do I mean by this? Well a normal competitive sports game would allow each player on each team an equal chance of scoring and thus winning. The same set of physical and logical rules applies to every player much like in the real world. This is not the case with rocket league. Different physics apply to different players and the game adjusts these parameters to favor one side over the other about 90% of the time.How is the game rigged exactly? Two principal types of rigging apply in Rocket League Camera rigging and entity physics rigging. Camera rigging occurs when the action you see on your screen does not reflect the action that happens in the game. One of the most basic camera rigs in RL is the classic missing the ball trick. You charge towards the ball expecting a hit only to brush by wide left wide right too low or too high. Or you hit the ball at the incorrect contact point. This is NOT a bug. This is NOT (always) due to lack of skill in fact highly skilled players miss these shots because Rocket League's piece of junk Ballcam (otherwise known as Shitcam) can and does generate optical illusions at will. This is one way RL rigs the game against you increasing the chances that you miss your shots or miss the ball entirely.The second type of rigging comes from a tweaking of the game physics themselves. One common scenario in RL is when two players hit the ball at the same time. Rocket league uses physics to calculate the path of the ball following the collision. However it can choose from not one but several paths within a degree of uncertainty. One path might head towards the center of the field. Another might head straight into your goal. You as the player can't tell the difference because all of those paths look valid given the physics of the game. But in real life the several paths scenario is complete and utter t much like most of Rocket League. RL *deliberately* selects the path that will conform to the way the game is rigged whether it's against you or for you. If you have saved replays of matches you suspect are rigged I urge you to look at them and in slow motion. You will begin to notice that some ball touches don't look right. The trajectory of the ball is too high too low too slow too fast etc. It's not you. It's Psyonix (Shytonix) who has stacked the odds against you.There's a third type of rigging but it's not really rigging. Just players cheating and believe me there are plenty enough to feed to all the starving zoo lions in the world. Cheats seen frequently in the game include Speed hacks noticeable when the player is twice the distance from the ball as you are and somehow is able to hit the ball at 100 kph into your goal even though you clearly hit the ball away from them first. Speed hacks can affect dodge speed boost speed or both. Aimbot hard to spot but used by low skill players who want to impress you with their fake (completely cheated) aerial skills and impossible angle shots Auto Demolition which decreases the speed at which you need to hit an opponent to make them explode. The dead giveaway here is to watch low speed collisions turn into BOOMs. Anti demolition the opposite of the above where a player can avoid being exploded even when the opponent rams into the player at the highest velocity possible. Again easily spotted from replaysNow would you really like to pay $20 to play a game that's rigged from the getgo and infested with cheaters? Your choice ),Rocket League®,1,1200,3537,646,1

12/20/2017,0,0,41,Recommended,Incredible Game. Having played both the Test Server and Base Game I love this game. It's a fun mix of casual gameplay challenge and fun. The only problems I can see are the many glitches but luckily they do not happen often but a lot of them do cause you to have to exit a match or lose one early. I am hoping these glitches are gone in 1.0. The new map Miramir is an intresting mix of urban combat and vast open spaces. With the new vaulting and climbing animations being added the game is ironing itself out. Weapons are a definite mix of good and bad with luck and tactics being a massive part of finding the good weapons like a Kar98K or an M4. Overall The game is a masterpiece and is definitely (IMHO) better than Fortnite. (I have played Fortnite so I think I can make that Comparison). 9.7/10,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,41,800,153,3

That's it you just wasted 15 mins because of few kids.

2/1/2014,0,0,8,Not Recommended,After a lot of looking around I bought this game. It's really reaaaaally early access. Having said that for an early access game it's actually really good. But (before you have to read everything here) I don't recommended you buy it YET.Don't expect a story any help from the game any objectives. If I sum up what the game is about now You start on a huge island (map is impressive) and have to survive with nothing but a rock. You can interact with stuff to get more stuff. You need to eat keep warm and DON'T DIE! There are zombies but only a couple. You have to have wood and stone to make a hatchet to kill animals (the rock is too slow p) to get food and cloth and more stuff. You can build huts beds fires all those things. It is actually quite fun to do for a couple of hours.There's a lot of negative reviews about people getting killed by others constantly. I didn't have a problem with that (I managed to die on my own quite a bit tyvm p). What I did have problems with is the interface (or lack there off). No help there and it depends on the server if you can /help /who etc.TIP if you do decide to get this 'game' pick a good server!! Look for newb friendly no deterioration (unless you want to built your hut back up everytime you dont play for a couple days) instant craft (or half craft &lt that's about craft times). For now I don't think the price is worth it and well it's just not done enough for me. After a couple hours I was kind of done with it. 4/10. Not recommended at the moment. Might shape up nicely.

Totally worth it.The gameplay is similar to Minecraft so comparisons to it are warranted however the immersion level of Astroneer is in my opinion far greater. One moment you're traipsing across a verdant field of some random planet and the next you're running for your life to find oxygen or shelter from a massive wind storm.Originally I was drawn in by the minimalistic graphical art style which I love and I was kept engaged by the gameplay. As more features are added to the game I can see that I'm going to be sinking a LOT of hours into Astroneer. When I have more available funds I intend to purchase a copy for my son as well so that we can play together.As long as these developers don't go all 'Paradox games' on their customers and instead add lots of free features and content the upside for this game will be enormous.

Yeah that's not good because Rockstar can ban you for it even though you didn't do anything wrong.There is a solution though. You can press ""M"" and in the options you can set yourself up to be in ""Passive Mode"". That means people can't kill you shoot you run you over blow you up knife you hijack you or otherwise inconvenience you. The downside is while in ""Passive Mode"" you can't use weapons can't punch or mug citizens get involved in random events or participate in server events. You can however steal cars go into stores start or join missions/races/death matches/etc... So there are plusses and minuses.Over all my single player and on line experiences have been great and I think the game was well worth the money I spent to get it. On sale of course.",Grand Theft Auto V,5,816,1371,253,5

Rust.....ark.....Big example h1z1......reign of kings....... conan exiles......arma 3......now Im' not saying its only asians that cheat Im' just saying they cheat a lot more than NA players do.... This all is why I would not reccomend this game... Our cultures do not mesh well... our views on fairplay obviously do not mesh.... Please make them play asian servers.... We do not want to tolerate cheaters or people who cannot speak english..... It has nothing to do with xenephobia... This game requires team cohesion to play.... not broken english and yelling..... More than half of steams users are chinese thanks to pubg.... Look up the stats..... Brenden green you're really hurting your game by forcing NA players to tolerate Asian players.... Even tarkov has region lock EVEN TARKOV so why not your PUBG....? Maybe if someones pings over 500.. JUST MAYBE they might be ruining the game for everyone else on the server who actually lives around where the server is being hosted.. You know people that don't have 500 ping...... NOT HALF WAY AROUND THE GLOBE....

8/19/2018,0,0,544,Recommended,The game itself is very fun however it is difficult to master. It is extremely competitive and therefore there are also many people who chose to hide throughout the game which can sometimes be annoying but it is part of the game. Once you understand the way people play and their tendencies you can take advantage of their situation by for example nading a house which they are inside of. The final 20 is usually very intense especially in Miramar where there is very little cover. Luckily the game provides three different maps Sanhok Miramar and Erangel. All three are different with Miramar and Erangel being large and spaced out while Sanhok being smaller and the games being faster. In order to be good you have to learn how to play on each map. One of the things the game could use is offline mode or the option to have a shooting range to practice such as in CS GO. I wish I could practice using different weapons as I know that would improve my gameplay a lot. I also wish the queue time would be shorter as a couple weeks ago it was great and has since became quite horrible. Overall I would give this game a solid 7/10 as it is very fun and time consuming however the terrible server waiting time and the lack of practice facilities is something that makes this game hard to commit to.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,544,1295,240,5

6/24/2017,0,0,1153,Not Recommended,"Never before has there been a more storied example of Games Publisher vs. Game Developer than the Grand Theft Auto franchise. Rockstar games has put out several middling to excellent installments in its 20 year history churning out these open world sandbox story driven criminal based games and GTA V is about a 7 out of 10 by comparison to all of the other GTA games. Gone is physics based water enemy stagger movie theater sound effects and a compelling thrilling narrative throughout as was the case in GTA IV. In its place is a larger map. More vehicles. Compelling online play. And a new story gimmick called 'Heists'. Which give the player multiple options crews and equipment loadouts to try and take some of the most sought after scores in San Andreas.Graphics GTA was one of the most visually stunning games to look at of its time...and yet its detailed graphics menu allowed players to play on last gen computers as well. Now the engine and the objects are starting to show their age. Polygonal hard edges distant traffic stand ins (which can't be adjusted) foliage pop in and ugly online player models are the seams in this game's visual cloth. These problems are not the only graphical ones but none of them are significant enough to ruin the experience by itself.Gameplay Mileage always varies in GTA. When choosing what you want to do in this game you're always going to seem like you have a number of different options both in online and offline modes. The story is long and touches a lot on GTA's lorebase a number of memorable times. But when those strings of narrative are woven together to make a cloth the result is pretty mediocre. By contrast in GTA IV and even the game's 2 excellent expansions we saw characters grow and develop over the course of the story changing their views and stances on certain issues. Nico Bellic who starts out as a cagey quiet soldier despite numerous transgressions and setbacks finds it in himself to trust those he loves and makes a new home for himself in Liberty City. This kind of development doesn't happen in GTA V's story mode. That's pretty disappointing. The characters at the end are the same sarcastic gun toting badasses that they are at the beginning. Nothing really changes of importance.Car handling is different. GTA IV's cars were floaty and drifty. Even the most hardcore supers had flex in the suspension when you showed them quick turns in rapid succession. In V all of that has been dumbed down a little. Cars are twitchy and responsive. Some have so much grip that they will not bite back unless you're driving around with your right trigger pressed full down at all times. Not all cars are set up with such leeways but especially in the next gen versions driving is a bit of a cakewalk.Shooting is VERY different. Every time I return to GTA IV I'm floored by how simplistic its shooting system is. Weapons can't be modified and the cover system gets confused very easily. In V it seems they cracked it. Not only is there a 1st person element to shooting which has you looking down the sights of your weapon but the accuracy of all firearms has been ramped substantially. Unfortunately enemy AI still seems especially weak with Rockstar doing more of its ""Quantity over quality"" approach to enemy design. Not once did the AI succeed in tricking me or scaring me to the point where I had to rethink my strategy. Despite a few times with the cover not locking on to the right object it's very serviceable. This reviewer would like to see nuances like (lenient) weapon condition and windage at long range play a factor in future games. Sizeable improvements in AI are also urgently needed.Flying is well done. Especially in helicopters but it's clear Rockstar stuck with its guns and revamped the same chopper system from GTA IV which was good. The aircraft have a good weight to them and the momentum they carry feels realistic. Swimming/boats are well done. Probably the most underrated experience in GTA history if you ask me. At least since Vice City the need for awesome pilotable boats has been certainly needed. The game's only sailboat however cannot be sailed. It's motor only. Online/Expansions are where the game really starts to disappoint. Every one of the game's DLC packs have been free which is excellent but what's not excellent is they've all been for online only which indicate that Take Two's marketing strategy has triumphed over the gamer's desire for more things to do in singleplayer. Online itself has its own independent heist system which is like Payday Lite. The 5 heists have a decent narrative component in which you learn why it is you're doing what you're doing and occasionally see parts of the story mode's backstory. Unfortunately the online lobbies are plagued with some of the worst flagrant examples of cheating and poor matchmaking that I have ever seen in a video game. I have on multiple occasions had all of my character's weapons and ammo drained from my inventory. On all occasions I reported the incident to Rockstar but their policy on griefing is more of a confused shrug than a commitment to do anything about it. You can get killed in passive mode by god choppers. You can try to complete a daily objective for your business only to find out the VIP you're supposed to be defending got killed by a grenade teleported onto his head from a mile away. These are just some minor examples that Rockstar doesn't seem to have a handle on.Sound/Audio GTA V's soundtrack is great except for a few glaring omissions like a lack of an electronic station. Worldwide FM which is the closest thing is often a very confusing mix of tracks that seem like they were just thrown against a wall to see what sticks. Other sounds like those associated with driving and combat sound great. I wish that they'd done a few more engine samples though. Some of them are quite overused. I am so glad they finally decided to update the gunplay sound effects. Many of them from GTA IV were tedious. Especially that police pistol one. You know what I mean.Replay Value This one's tricky. That's going to depend on what you want to do in this game. If you're flexible and want to do everything there's no deeper game on the market for satisfying all of your chaotic sandbox desires. If you just want a driving game there are some competitive racing crews out there but the physics model is just a little too limited and at times buggy to represent a polished racer. Also it's automatic transmission only which will rightly irk some racing game enthusiasts. If you want a shooter there are a lot of compelling reasons to choose GTA V. First person and third person modes are both very satisfying to play with and it's versatile enough to support KB/M and controller setups. Still its weak AI and sometimes annoying bugs with cover mean you should be considering dedicated shooters as well before GTA V. Management/Direction Awful. Appalling. Ghastly. Dreadful. Worse than you're imagining right now. Take 2's ponderous approach to its marketing scheme has been recently underscored by its tonedeafness toward mods. Something that takes GTA V's playability and improves upon what's already there. This is even more glaring because they have failed to fix the obvious problems with cheaters in online mode. It's pretty laughable really. The only logical reason I can figure that they haven't fixed the issue is that they can't be bothered or don't care about the gaming community that they are responsible for. And that makes perfect sense as Take Two continues to ruin everything good about its games in steady slow succession.As it is right now I can't recommend this for 59.99. It's probably worth about 9.99 given how large TTI's profit margin has been so far. If that.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,1153,7759,1349,1

Moreover after reporting these cheaters you don't have any feedback report of what became of that player. if they ckecked it or banned... or nothing..Another thing is that this game has one of the worst player base ever seen. Most of the games you start looting for about 15 mins finding yourself only to give what you got to the first cheater around the corner. Wall hacks autoaim and many others cheats are in full use in this game. Don't take me wrong the game is good but the lack of moderation has destroyed a good game. I found myself playing with guys that they found right using cheats just because they don't know how to play but want to have fun. So these players don't care if the destroy others' enjoyment of the game they just want to be there and have ""fun"" using cheats to get kills. So when every legit player will be gone who will have the Chicken Dinner?

The great art style I also love the collectable toppers and antennas which are always fun and never seem to run out with the new season 2 if there is anything i dislike about the game i woud have to say i dont have a large problem with the game but i do have a small problem with the ranked U.I and how it is configured I would like to see the game implement a leaderboards type page in the game where you can view all the different ranks and the players in said rank with their stats so you can see how you stack up against other players in your rank or maybe even players in higher ranks. but back to the review. the party up system is very easy and simple. overall great game gamplay is great Gameplay 10/10 Graphics 10/10Ranked/Competitive modes 8/10Playing with friends 10/10 New updates 10/10,Rocket League®,5,1047,1021,192,5

8/12/2018,0,0,308,Recommended,Pros This game carries over all the good parts of the Monster Hunter series and conveniently smoothens or eases the parts that were at times frustrating.All the little things like gathering herbs while walking instead of a 3s animation swapping weapons on the hunt crafting wishlists make this game by far the most enjoyable of the series.And the graphics are amazing! The world feels alive now and the monsters feel so much more monster y as well.Cons I have not had issues with it myself but lots of players mention server connection issues sometimes even in singleplayer(which is still an online session but a private one).These issues have plagued the console release as well where they were fixed shortly after launch.There are also lots of mentions about mouse acceleration although this is a game like Dark Souls. Mouse works but it is not really intended for it. This game is meant to be played with a gamepad.Overall I would say this game is definitely enjoyable right now.If you planned to play with some buddies and don't want to deal with potential multiplayer issues give it a week or two and the issues should be fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,308,1133,195,5

3/2/2018,0,0,321,Not Recommended,Good concept bad implementation. This should still be in early access. Full retail price plus paid loot boxes. Inconsistent shooting and hit detection. They have made a ridiculous amount of money selling this game which would mean they could afford bigger and better teams to work on the game but updates still feel poorly implemented always cause more glitches and dont seem to address the core issues with the game (ping abuse hit detection low server tick cheaters the list goes on). Winning is a heck of a rush and makes the frustrations seem worth it for a time but that novelty wears off quick and the game could be amazing if not for the technical issues.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,321,662,117,1
7/8/2016,0,0,34,Recommended,Good game idea and plays well I could imagine that this game would be fun to play with five friends but from a single player perspective it can get really annoying and frustrating because of the lack of people who actually help you when you are stuck on a hook or being hunted down by the killer. Another problem with the game is that you cannot search for a public game with friends (that I know of) meaning that unless you have five friends to play with then you are unable to play with friends at all. The game doesn't include any in game chat meaning that you are unable to communicate with your teammates. Overall I would recommend this game to people that have enough friends that own the game to play with.,Dead by Daylight,3,34,713,134,3

11/26/2017,0,0,944,Not Recommended,Great game all round single player and multi player. Game devs are constantly adding new modes or lots more of different types of racing content. New cars / some armored some not weaponzing of some cars etc. Single player storyline you switch from character to character for different parts of the missions some being the characters special abilities weather your playing as one of the three main charters stories lines. Michal has the ability to slow down time. ( great for out side shooting weather it be running or riding a bike helpful for the earlier on running of the marathons with the bikes. Franklin which you start out playing (after the main game intro play) has the ability in cars to slow down time. Great for the car racing missions. The first race mission might be a little tricky with his special skill being lower but after you develop it by using it more. ( it dose regenerate over time so use it as much as you can starting out to help you much faster along with game play since you switch from time to time and missions to missions.) Trevor the third character you run into for playing has the ability to take damage (when in this mode getting head shoots or more killing damage helps to regenerate the bar much faster.) Multiplayer the game has lots of great things to offer with it's share of plenty of not so fun times or bad experiences some can be a mix all depends on the community your playing with weather it be a solo session friends only clan invite only and open world. Everyone will or can have difference experiences in any of the different online open world multiplayer world. All maps are pretty much the same but you can find some differences in the single player and multiplayer modes. Weather it be cars / locations of some. or some buildings you can get into and some single player you can / can't same for the multi player version of the world map. Easter eggs can be found some in single player and multiplayers some it can only de done one or the other same for pc vs consoles some work on one but not the other and some work on both. (YouTube can be great finding some if they have glitches or exploits chances are they have been patched hopefully by now. so most of them shouldn't work.) Modding I personally never tried any on this game only gave that i have where legal mods for left 4 dead 2. Game dev's eliminated modding in the game. I seen some awesome game mods / modes for the game via YouTube livestreams etc. Game never ran correctly for me or high enough fps (frames per second) for me to even bother. Yet you still see even though devs have said to eliminated all modding you still see players on multiplayer seasons dropping in game money modded cars etc. players that should of been banded a long time ago yet for some reason Rockstar still seams to let theses people play on their game servers wrecking it for others some modders in games aren't always bad people so don't take that the wrong way but more of the time than not they end up wrecking a game mode event world or race by adding things that weren't meant to be on the map and they stay there till you restart the game after closing it out completely some of the mods even carried over to your single player world unintended if you didn't notice till you try to play it on the same night / day with out restarting your game. (still happens even after said they eliminated of all game mods/ modders....lies.) Sure they can fix or patch some thing but also a lop hole some where in coding flaws. Take 2 interactive which is part of the Rockstar. CEO plans to add to every new game they plan to release from this point forward in time to add micro transactions into every game. The companies way of saying your paying $60 for a game but where going to add lets say as easement for each game $0.99 to 150.00 extra real life money you have to spend in the game after you actually bought it at full price or sale of most new game average of $60.00 per new game maybe 1/2 of that on sale for a new full game lease / license. To the companies Their like yes we can **** even more people once they have bought our game They don't seam to care their all about just profits. Yes some of the in game transactions can be helpfully to players that don't want to waite or grind levels etc. so some can be beneficial to people from that stand point of view. However any thing like that you can buy with real money should be released as some thing you can or should be able to get with the same in game currency with little or no effort however that doesn't seem to be the case for most companies. If you treat your costumers correctly weather it being by making a great game you don't have to worry as much but if it's a half *** game with micro transactions then it's even worse. Without happy people or costumers game makes and companies eventually will go under or sink. For the developed game makes publishers devs etc most not all but more than it should be don't care as much after you buy their games so still do luckly. For RS (Rockstar) and 2k (take 2 interactive) I would say are more on the developed side of the spectrum. Yes they add more content to most of their games credit for that however the micro transactions not so much. Personally they could careless about their actually costumers after they buy the game. First hand experience with the company. Enjoy the new content updates for multiplayer open world and 2x rp adversity modes. Luckly they rotate some of them from shooting to driving modes etc. Might not always like every new update they offer but many like the verity to the game from time to time and sales on different random items or vehicles or mod upgrades weather it be built proof vest or car turbo upgrades or paint resprays for cars or ammunitions for your weapons or charges etc. upgrades for your apartments or upgrades for the biker club or other in game organizations. Little simple things that can help make the game a little easier or more fun some times or to help you out after struggling to get that next big upgrade of your dream lives your running in the game or organizations. For the main reason for the not recommending this game is as follows. Great game Yes single player and multiplayer yes and noLast time I voted two awards for this game in The Steam Awards and once for it in the current Steam awards. (it is a good game) However from my experiences with the company and someone who bought the game / licenses for pc and on console. Even gifted games from this company 2k and RS multi copys some for pc and console and many other games from the game devs and their makers. Had a problem with the game since i got it on pc for over two years. I had recently contacted the RS by phone to help trouble shoot to fix the problems.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,944,6786,1269,1

9/25/2015,0,0,969,Recommended,Rust is a game that you either love or hate. I personally love and hate Rust I love Rust because I enjoy the survival concept of the game and the building your own little or big base feature to keep all your loot safe. I also love the new Team Feature that was recently added to the game it makes it easier to keep track of where your friends have run off to! It also makes combat simpler if you are with a team of friends so you know which person to not shoot at in an intense battle. There are a lot more reasons why I like Rust but I have one reason why I hate it. The one thing I hate about Rust is the community. The community is very toxic and salty and very unfriendly. Now I m not the sort of person who normally gets mad over a game but the other players on this game somehow make you feel so aggressive by either teasing you in chat or talking a load of rubbish after they kill you. But overall I think this game is a good game and if the community wasn t so toxic I would honestly rate it 10 out of 10.But if you can deal with the toxic players then go for it and buy it. You can always get a refund if you don t enjoy the game.,Rust,5,969,1139,237,5

2/1/2019,0,0,27,Recommended,"Resident evil has always been a huge part of my life. As a kid all my older family members played them (1 3 at the time) and were constantly talking about it. I was too young to play it at the time of course (about 8 maybe?)...so what did I do? I snuck out of my room at night and played them with the strategy guide they had ). I remember countless nights running from the dead while keeping an ear out for the telltale squeak of the floor of someone getting up. Not only did zombies send me running so did avoiding my parents. Pausing the game turning off the T.V and running back to my room became just as much a reflex as combining herbs. Every time I heard a toilet flush and a door close behind I would go back into the nightmare. I played them the entire time my family was talking about them but I could never join the discussion without giving myself away. I was the envy of all my freinds my age at school for having played them and one of the ""cool kids"" for those older who had. As I grew up and I no longer had to hide I began playing all of the classic and new resident evils regularly and they have been some of my favorite games all time. Come 2019 the are remaking my favorite of all the series resident evil 2! I wait in anticipation praying to the AAA gods for a good dice roll and not land 76. It comes out just before my birthday to rave reviewes. I quickly put my money together to try and afford the 80$ price here and Canada. Alas I should have put in more overtime at work. However to my suprise a good freind of mine Mr.ronoc gifts it to me as a present. What. A. Legend. Back into the classic nightmare I go.I make sure to buy myself the classic sound pack and boot up the game. I am greeting with the familiar ""Resident evil....2!"" and I grin ear to ear in nostalgia immediatly back in my parents living room at 2 in the morning. Ready to shoot some zombies. As I play all the old memories come flooding back as I run around a glorius HD rendition of the police station I spent so much time in. I know it like my own home. Running past zombies solving puzzles. All with the original soundtrack.This game is a masterpiece for new comers and veterans alike. Thank you capcom for letting me relive my childhood in such an awesome way. Solid 10/10 goty contender for sure. Time for a 4th run through ).Now just remake 3!!!!!!!",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,3,27,2350,457,3

8/27/2017,1,1,4428,Not Recommended,Before you read the my review please look at how many hours I have played on thsi game. Did you look? Good. Now the single player mode is pretty good love the story and the 3 characters. However there is no dlc for the single player mode in which R* focuses on the online mode. Now with 4 000+ hours of playing time and never using an exploit cheat glitch hack beg/accepted money from hackers how come I am punished by having my money taken away from me? Never once did I do any of those things and R* punishes me. Not only that but I still didn't get all the stuff from the gunrunning dlc. That doesn't even include all the things I wanted to get from previous dlc. 4000 hours and still not able to get everything from a single dlc. Way to go R* for making everything so expensive and punish innocent people like me just because I'm trying to grind my money to purchase said dlc. I would say wait for this game to be on sale for 30 bucks to buy it because the single player is amazing. As for the online mode it is a waste of time and money as R* never fixes the problems and blames the innocent people for its unfairness and treats hackers like they are the gods of the game.SP 10/10MP 0/10all in all 5/10EDIT Steam Sale 10/27/2017 WOW It's out for half price FINALLY for how many years now?

1/25/2017,0,0,150,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is one of those games I feel weird about even after dropping near 200 hours on my original game when I picked it up for the Xbox 360 only to realize I'm a over a year down the road when the PC release game about. Luckily enough Rockstart had the foresight to allow people to fix their deadly error of buying this shiny game on a dying console. So first off that's one huge beautiful point in Rockstar's court so I wouldn't have to grind up my online character again just to get my shiny penthouse that I haven't visited in so long I almost forgot where it was in spite of it being marked on the map.Anyways. GTA V's single player feels like a strong fleshed out GTA game running well in the same vein each of the previous installments have but much more shiny and smooth with so much to do stealing some poor bastards car may actually end up falling off the top ten to do list after a few rounds of golf mucking about on an arcade machine holding up a virtual 7 11 and the now almost absurd amount of other activities which have been added as Rockstar pumps out free content. Problem is none of the free content pours into the single player experience and we're stuck with a vanilla game that hasn't gone anywhere. Not that I miss it much as the online offers far more to do than the single player with something of a reward if not at least a sense that your actually building yourself up for something.But in the single player you will be met with three seperate characters who you will play as who all have their unique abilities which all don't mean much for other than their main special ability so long as your a competent human being capable of understanding basic controls. Which arises my single and only problem in the GTA games. Difficulty curve. Now I'm not saying it's not there but GTA V almost feels like it holds your hand a bit too tight over the course of the single player and never really punishes you if you muck up. Not that this is a bad thing but the sense of risk and reward in single player leaves something to be desired. Otherwise the experience is still exceptional in just about every other way. Beautiful and pretty damned big city to roam about and cry havoc and release the hogs of war. Or dogs. Whichever.As for the online it's essentially the single player experience but partially populated with the stew of the gaming community. Most people are there just to play and have a fun time running people over selling drugs stealing drugs blowing drugs up and just about every other major crime under the sun. Problem is as is the fault with all online games you will consistantly run into people who feel it necessary to cheat in the online. You'll suddenly see another player spawn twenty feet from you blow you up with some kind of Iranian superweapon and you suddenly realize they've Harry Pottered their way across the the entire map and over the course of the next five minutes have killed every single player in the lobby while uttering less than acceptable phrases. Rockstar makes it easy enough to report and kick players problem is I've found a sad amount of people don't even know how to access the player list to report or kick which confuses me but then again I'm the type of nimrod who gladly stares at menus early on for ten minutes to know where everythings at.In the end in this poorly written review Grand Theft Auto V is a remarkable game worth your time and money if you have an immense amount of time to devote to a single game as if you were in some kind of digital monogomy and you accidentally knocked up Grand Theft Auto and it's father is keeping a shotgun pressed firmly against your buttocks until you've ground up enough money to afford a penthouse so you can continue onto bigger and better heists and other various missions.Pros Excellent single player Beautiful graphics Expansive radio selection Fleshed out gameplay Almost MMO like multi player without too many of the typical MMO tropes New content releases regularly giving plenty to do in the onlineCons Huge file size you better make sure you've partitioned some disk space or free some up You'll find a hacker/modder in almost every online lobby Single player doesn't feel like it has much post game content other than typical activitiesI'm sure I could give much better pros and cons but honestly they wouldn't have enough gravity to mention. Well. Maybe. Probably could find more but Grand Theft Auto V is a damn good game and in spite of any other flaws I guarentee you'll have tons of fun with it.,Grand Theft Auto V,4,150,4539,827,4

The social aspect is pretty large in this game and there is nothing like downing a group of 3 4 noobs and looting/scrapping them before they can return.... or being the victim of numberless gang 'encounters'.

1/18/2018,0,0,73,Recommended,GTA V Single Player Review (spoiler free)I just finished the story of GTA V. I bought the game for 30 when it was on sale because I wanted to play a game with a great story with my XBOX controller. Basically this is what I got.GTA V is a great GTA but it didn't dig me as I was expecting it. I was hoping for a successor to GTA San Andreas and had really high expectations. I missed the feeling to start from the button and work my way up to become rich and so on. In GTA V the success comes too fast. In my opinion you get the nice house car etc. too early. I also didn't identify with the characters as much as in previous GTA titles. The radio stations are good but they also didn't convince me as a legit successor to previous titles. Also you can't eat in restaurants you can't buy street food you can't train your body. It makes no sense for me to buy cars. It makes no sense to me to train the pet of one of the characters. So all in all it has all the core elements of a good GTA but it is not the big thing I was hoping for.It is a good game. I am recommending it. It is fun to play. The story is okay.

(they actually said this.). Considering this game is currently the 4th most sold game of all time this simply cannot be the case. They are not diversifying their products enough and are trying to suck as much money out of their customers as they can whilst providing minimal content a terrible online functionality and overall terrible online experience.Because of this anti consumer mentality and behavior I advise never purchasing any game made by Take 2 interactive or their subsidiaries which includes Rockstar Games.Rockstar Games is pro modding as you can see from their social media posts and general pro modding attitude. Unfortunately their parent company has made a decision that I refuse to support and cannot stand for. I will no longer buy anything from this software developer and will deter anyone I can from purchasing anything from this developer.Until they revoke the cease and desist and prove that they are indeed pro consumer and not trying to milk thier customers for every dollar they have I will no longer buy anything from this company and highly highly discourage anyone else from buying from them as well.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,283,1396,235,1

9/15/2017,0,0,50,Recommended,So I've had my ups and downs with DBD. I love the premise and the game is thrilling to play and a ton of fun. But glitches can make it really frustrating at times. Bad geometry on the maps can ruin your chase glitchy walls can allow the killer to get off illegal hits and of course there's a decent number of facecamping killers and salty survivors. Despite all that I still love to play this game and recommend it provided you back up your saves after you play because that lose all progress bug is naaaaaaasty. Took the devs almost two weeks to fix my account although they did give me a huge number of bloodpoints to apologize (but couldn't restore my shards so I lose out on the teachable I wanted!)

The asian hackers are toxic and all over the NA servers and now that they have enabled kill cams its so much easier to confirm you were killed by a hacker. Devs need to stop working on improving the game and focus 100% on anti cheat until they can get it figured out. Hackers have litterally killed the game for me...might give Xbox PUBG a try.

1/29/2014,0,0,90,Recommended,"This game is one of the most brutal PvP games I've ever had the chance to play. I played DayZ when it was starting and growing as an Arma2 mod and that was fine and dandy but this game takes the cake. The crafting system is more of what DayZ needs and with the plentiful expansions that will be coming in future weeks and months this game is shaping up to be the essence of an ""MMO"" survival game. The server size is just right for the size of the map guns feel rightly powerful for everything you go through to make them (or take them) and building a house in a game has never made me struggle to use supplies sparingly as much as Rust does.The one complaint I have currently is the amount of cheaters present in game but I can honestly say that those that I've had the displeasure of meeting and reporting (along with a gorup of reports from friends) haven't been seen again. Last thing play it with friends. Coax them into playing it with you none of you will regret it so long as you help each other out. The map is nowhere near as absurdly huge or barren as Chernarus in DayZ finding your friends won't be extremely difficult and there is definite strength in numbers. Watching a group of seven people in full armor chasing after you with bows and arrows pistols and rifles is probably a frightening sight as I've never been on the other side of it but it's better to be wielding the guns yeah?Overall great as far as Early Access goes some laggy rubberbanding that should be ironed out in the coming weeks but not a bad investment in the slightest.

Oh yeah I forgot that you won't because all you want is for people to play a million hours and/or pay for your microtransactions of ingame currency. Even I fell for that trash market practice before.The online element of this game has gradually gotten more and more expensive it's ludicrous and I can't blame anyone for wanting an easy way to get rich.Other choice is making the online a standalone so people playing singleplayer with mods can still have their fun.GTA Online is what I play mostly so my review is mostly based on that + the modding community's rage.. If it wasn't for that I would have given GTA V a recommendation but for now this game gets a massive thumb down.(And I can clearly see I'm not the only one)It's appears they didn't want to make a fun game they wanted to make a goldmine for themselves where players are the miners.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,391,1720,298,1

8/20/2017,0,0,133,Recommended,"I want it to be known before i say anything this is an early access game. Its bound to have some issues with it. (though personally its like 2017 and some issues happening rn is kinda like ""what?"" but we'll get into that)PROS 1) Fun as hell gun play with bullet drop and attachments to upgrade your guns around the map2) The feel good moment when you win a gun fight actually makes you feel amazing (at least to me anyway)3) 3 types of gamemodes solo duo and squads. solo for solo duo for 2 players and squads for 3 4 players4) Some players in this game are really fun with the proximity voice chat you could yell at eachother playfully talk to eachother or some other dumb things that could be fun5) Not a wide variety of guns but a pretty good amount for you to think about a favorite (And plus they are adding more and more as time goes on)6) Supply crates will drop around the map holding some REALLY good gear but a lot of players will be going for it so its that whole fighting to the death for it i love7) This isnt just a run and gun shooter either you will most likely to use everything you have to win a game and you need to choose when and how to fight and always check around you for other players trying to get the drop on you8) A crate system that lets you buy them with IN GAME CURRENCY that once opened gives you some clothes some looking better than others (Right now there is a crate you need to buy a key for with $$$ but its only for this event and the money goes to raise funds for events prizepool for tournaments as well as charity so i dont see an issue)CONS 1) They REALLY need a volume slider for gun shots or grunts your character makes when shot im a very jumpy person so when i get shot i freak out for a second because its pretty loud when its quiet. (This is just kinda personal/for jumpy people though)2) Like i said its a early access game so its gonna have some issues but one i just cant wrap my head around is the graphics not loading in once you are forced to pull the parachute at first i thought it was just me but going on reddit and other foarms i saw it was happening to other people. and when i say graphics dont load i mean you are looking at a building that looks like it was from ps1 and if you enter that building you have a constant falling animation and sometimes you'll frames will DROP hard im talking slideshow sort of deal. This REALLY sucks when its early game and you should be looking for a gun to fight with but instead you run around the map like a headless chicken. (Although there is a way to force your graphics to load when you are forced to pull your parachute then hit tab to open your inventory and your screen will freeze for a bit but once it comes back your graphics will load but it really does suck sometimes because it takes a while sometimes honestly i shouldnt have to do this EVERY game i play now but i do so i dont die waiting for my graphics to load.) RANT OVER lol 3) RNG plays a role in this game as it IS a battle royale game but it kinda sucks when you get the short end of the stick with loot and you see this dude with full armor helmet and rifle and all you got its a pistol with level 1 body armor.4) This game should be WAY more optimised then it is right now my computer may not be the best computer on the world but its also not potato. I can run recent games no problem even on the max settings. I shouldnt be pushed to use VERY LOW on almost everything like i do with this game. (Which really sucks because some people have no problems with the game is it look SO PRETTY on their screens while im playing a ps1 game. This also ties into the whole graphics wont load point i made)5) The game is pretty low on content with older players sense they arent adding new things right now and focusing on fixing bugs and help the game on a technical level which is totally fine. But i bring this up because for some people this game MAY get boring after a while so be ready for all of that when getting into the gamePERSONAL 1) I get house sitting is a strat but when i die to it i want to die in real life honestly2) There can be some annoying people in the voice chat if you have it on its hard to describe but youll know what kind of people im talking about if you play this game for a while (Though this can be fixed by mutting the voice chat)3) I wish they would work on the snow map over the desert map honestly i hate desert maps.4) ""CAN I GET A MOTHER ING CAR??? JESUS I HAVE BEEN RUNNING FOR 5 MINUTES STRAIGHT"" honestly sameOVERALL this is is fun when it works though i wanna bring this up as well. solo is NO WHERE nearly as fun as duo or squads. This game is such a co op game that i have trouble in solo because it gets to boring. If you got friends to play with this will be your game its super fun with friends. If you are interested in this game i say give it a chance maybe $30 is a stretch... but i say it COULD be worth that much but its hard to saw with the state its in right now. gl and hf in your games non the less though.7/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,133,5031,1006,4

6/18/2017,0,0,18,Not Recommended,I bought this game while it was on sale here on th Steam storefront. I had purchased the original PS3 version way back when this game was brand new. Not exactly day one but it might've been a day or two after it had been oout on the market. I gave my PS3 and the digital copy of the game to a friend a friend who split the bill for buying this game in the first place . I managed to try out the newer generation ports over at another person's house on the Xbox One. I was fairly impressed but $60 for a re release seems a tad bit much. Even for an assumingly huge studio like Rockstar. I told myself if ever I were to get into PC gaming proper I would try this game out with the incentive to replay the campaign story mode at my own pace rather than speeding throught it like I had to around launch. Then once I was finished with the story mode I would install and play mods. Because it's a Grand Theft Auto port for Windows a series reknown for it's modding community on the PC gaming side of the industry. While it's not the sole reason I bought the game for a second time mind you it is a major reason as to why I did in the first place. So I finally own a real gaming PC get the game a few weeks after that and when I beat the game I decided to take a break from it. Having spent a few days on it. Then I found out that the main way of modding the game had been deemed illegal. Which is beyond inept. I don't care for online I don't want to shill out more money to Take Two or even to Rockstar. And I was a huge fan of your games still am. But this is degrading to everybody and I'm honestly upset that I bought this game again. It would've been better off if I had only stuck with the memories of having played it a few years back then try to climb back into a newer package with the possibility to have my experience be even more fun. Giving the game more of a lifespan. I'm actually ashamed to have bought this off of Steam. I now know I should've gotten something else on sale instead. Wasted my cash on something that doesn't want me to play it how I want to. I bought the damned game I should be allowed to play and do whatever with it I want as long as I'm not ruining other people's experiences with it or pirating the game. Which I would not do. I just wanted to play with mods and the companies in charge took away the players' right to do so. I'm glad the community is taking a stand. Hopefully OpenIV will be reinstated and left alone. It doesn't mess with online and from what I'm told your servers are flooded with terrible cheaters anyhow not even related to modding. It's too late for me to get a refund but if I could I would. I'm done writing the points been made so many times by now. I hope this sends a clear message to whoever made the decision up the latter of corporate meatheads. A decent port with a little something extra now stripped of what made it stand out. Unless this is fixed I won't be supporting Rockstar or Take Two any further.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,18,2969,592,1

I dont believe I have played a single game without running into some pretty serious/ annoying issue. I found running the game on the lowest possible settings got rid of half of the issues but its already such an ugly game I could hardly justify lowering graphics to make the game run slightly better. Basically after 30 hours I gave up on the game and will not be back until i see some serious overhauling.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,47,943,173,1

3/14/2015,12,96,159,Not Recommended,"First I should say that I was given this game for free by people in the game industry and I've been in the game industry myself for 8 years. I shall try to be as unbiased and factual as possible but obviously some things are anecdotal.For whatever good intentions anyone might have had at FacePunch Studios Rust carries the unmistakable impression that it is an R&amp D Tech demo which keeps going through one iteration after the other while also managing to pull lots of money out of people. As an 8 year veteran in the game industry I say this is a scandal it is a scandal and not treating your customers as customers in any adult sense.As far as I can tell they (FacePunch) operate as though this whole thing was a joke. It shows in how they do their ""release cycles"" it shows in how they built the original iteration out of stuff straight from the Unity Engine it shows in the numerous reports I've read about how they haphazardly ban people from their forum for saying negative things (even in a polite fashion!) it shows in how they still proceed to market their game it shows in what I've seen in them forcing control of people's rented servers (nobody should have that right..nobody not them not DayZ not anyone) and most of all it shows in how one can almost feel the complacency from FacePunch Studios I could be very wrong but it really does seem like there is at least an indirect mentality of not being in any hurry to finish this game since they already have people's money.All this aside from the technical points I made could be mistaken views on my part but it seems increasingly unlikely as time goes by.TL/DR I do NOT recommend Rust to ANYONE. Avoid it as much as you can until they have something to show for it ..and even then I still think you should avoid it. In my view their behaviour so far has voided them any further support unless they make great efforts to make up for it.",Rust,2,159,1902,353,2

6/15/2017,0,0,144,Recommended,Was a great game while mods in single player actually existed. Now TakeTwo have made mods illegal. Don't buy it if you don't have it it's a broken game as of now. No content nothing to do anymore.Update (18/06/2017) I'd have thought that due to the increasingly negative reviews TakeTwo might've reconsidered this situation. Nope. They're breaking the game more and more each day. Solution? Don't buy the game. It'll save you the 40 in case you were buying it to mod single player.Update (15/08/2018) I'm very late to edit this review but mods are back. They're starting to pay more attention to online cheaters and cheat devs and single player is fun as ever... fun.,Grand Theft Auto V,4,144,667,116,4

4/3/2014,0,0,281,Not Recommended,"I used to play this game back in legacy. I loved it then. Now it is a completely different story and nothing but a waste of time in the end. Unfortunately that's how it will always be.This game is a breeding ground for the worst types of behaviors that can come out of people and perpetuates its own toxicity by actively punishing players who try to play without being rude and rewarding players who are. Because of this the community will always be one of the most poisonous and disgusting things that i've ever seen come out of a game.All the things that make this game great... or should I say once did are now what cripples the game. The combat system is fast paced and gets your adrenaline going the downside is that the combat (a VERY large part of the game) is also completely broken. Hitboxes are about as fine tuned as CS 1.6 guns are sloppy and have no actual feel to their weight or usage. The survival aspect of the game is all but gone. Food and water? Nah not important just pick up the hundreds of scattered mushrooms all over the ground and you're set. This once great survival game now no longer has any survival aspect to it the goal of the game is a rush to gather resources and blueprints build a base raid people and then have the server restart two weeks later so you lose your progress. Imagine playing a campaign game GTA V for exmaple getting to the final moments right before the final heist and your game crashes and corrupts your save and makes it unplayable. That is what the game in turn forces on to everyone.Want to know why servers have to restart every two weeks to a month? It's because the game lacks any sort of balance and in the end it corners server owners to have to restart the game so that it ""levels"" the playing field. In reality this doesn't fix anything. Once it's wipe day zergs come to the rescue to loot everything build a massive base and then proceed to raid everyone else without any challenge thus making it impossible for anyone that has a group of four or less to survive and actually progress.TL DR Quick List VERY POOR Optimization Broken Combat Unrealistic Weapons Unbalanced Awful Community NOT NP Friendly ZERGS Galore Overly Complicated For What It Is Lack Of Actual ProgressIf any of that sounds fun to you go ahead and ""enjoy"" the game.

8/11/2016,0,0,942,Recommended,I do not review often but I wanted to say this game is by far the best multiplayer horror game out there in a sea of failures. Granted there are still some bugs but the devs have been awesome about keeping up on them and giving us a Q&amp A Twitch stream on thrusday's to let us know what they are doing. They are awesome unlike other companies about not keeping you in the dark. If you want a fun game to chop up your friends or be a survivor and try not to get chopped up this is a great choice for that. The game has only done nothing but improve. We now have survive with your friends so you can team up too! Anyway I think if you were on the fence about this game it is time to jump on over and come play with us!Update I am gonna update and say I will still give this a thumbs up but the devs are listening to the community a little too much now and the game is becoming a bit one sided. Some bugs that have been here for a long time are still there. Not to mention the community is very toxic and little seems to be done about it. The game is still fun yes but it is very frustating at the same time. At this point in time I would say get it while it is on sale I would unfortunatly not pay full price for this untill a lot of things are addressed.,Dead by Daylight,5,942,1255,260,5
10/9/2017,0,0,109,Not Recommended,The core concept of the game is very fun and addicting winning gives you a rush you have never felt in a game before. In the current state however I can not recommend the game.Performance is hit or miss with every patch. Did I gain FPS or lost some? The game runs somewhat stable on i5 4690k 4.4 GHz 1070 GTX 16 GB RAM but I still get massive framedrops every few minutes.You never know what killed you. Was it a glitch was it a hacker was it just desync from the bad netcode? The lack of a shooting range or kill cam makes it very hard to get better at the game.Additionally there are questionable descisions being made by the developers. Resetting of your game mode (mainly Solo FPP) after every match hasn't been fixed since the release of FPP + your server resetting after the latest monthly patch. Post processing being forced on everyone because they couldn't fix a bug on the new fog map so they rather deploy it with a workaround. Don't get me started on the whole stream sniping controversy.I will try this game again after the next patch and see if there are any improvements but until then I would not buy this game.Update for 1.0 Insane rubberbanding in the beginning. Loot still spawns in late. Still couldn't fix that your previous selection of FPP/TPP gets carried over. Performance got a bit better.Update from July 2018 Game still runs like,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,109,1357,246,1

They are stuck at a loading screen with the logo which actually loads and on the background I can hear people talking and the plane the game actually is going on in the background. But it loads forever. I tried 2 hours to get it working by googling fixes but only 1 time I got it running with building loading problems and FPS problems on very low (with 5GB RAM and a nvidia gtx 1050ti all the other games existing are working on HIGH/ULTRA but this sucks on VERY LOW). When I started a game after 2 hours with launch options 10 youtube videos watched 200 google searches I couldn't enter in buildings because they weren't loaded.Overall I just want to buy a game and PLAY IT that's why I SPEND freaking 30 euros on it.

All i want to do is torture and kill everyone and yet all the killers in this game struggle to put a human on the ground. Then as a noob i run into pros frequently as survivors talking in discord and sending one person to troll the killer while they get 3 generators online by the time i catch this one person dropping all the pallets after playing ring around the rosey across the whole map. Then the survivors send one to save that person and by the time i find the next person because camping a hooked soul is frowned upon they have the next two generators online. Then they know the killer is struggling so they then go and hunt the killer down with flashlights and just stand around you trading turns with a flash light to increase their blood points. All the while leaving you the killer helpless hopeless Frustrated and most of all a weakling. I'm suppose to feel like i won if i even hooked them but then my game player name should be called the hooker not a killer. I'm the killer not a teddy bear.,Dead by Daylight,1,15,1058,201,1

10/11/2017,0,0,311,Not Recommended,Look the game as a whole could use a bit of work that being said... it is a fun game. The main problem is the recent monitization of the game.In Game Currency Basically pointless only can be used to buy crates which are 80% of the time locked for which you will have to buy a 2.50 key with real money to unlock. The other 20% of the time its an unlocked crates which contains nothing good.Battle Pass System Finally introducted something to work towards in the game instead of randomly playing. To bad they have put it behind a pay wall. And even if you pay its only for a limited time and the rewards from completion the missions are pretty For a game that cost $30 you would expect most content to be able to be earnt. Not as soon as you enter please pay us more money to not look like a pleb or to give you something to work toward. I dont have a problem with micro transcations but within reason. If they want a player base that will keep coming back they need to have a reason more than just try and win. In my opintion they need to make battle passes free or AT LEAST can be bought with in game currency.

( a bit of an exageration i know ) i got a gtx 960.. ive tried highest graphics settings.. got good fps.. put them on medium.. game is still as gorgeous to look at ( i honestly didnt see a difference between high and medium settings ).. got amazing fps.multiplayer works fine.. ive joined tons of missions.. and had ppl join mine completed missions no problem.only issue is joining a lobby with a load of people from start menuit doesnt work 100% of the time.. but no one uses their mics online anymore.. i dont see the point or need of doing thati can join missions fine through the sos feature.. and if i wanna play with friends.. private lobby works as it shouldgreat game.Positive from me,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,313,1448,263,5

At the very top we got at least 3m of air and hit another enemy player directly in the mouth completely by accident. He was sent flying a fatal distance to his death. Sadly we both died a few seconds later as the mountain was camped by every other player in the game. I was so amazed it was difficult to react after that happened. 8/10 would buy just for the random events that come about in battlegrounds.

2/1/2019,6,358,27,Recommended,I'll start by making it abundantly clear that I am a huge fan of the ace combat series. I have played to 100% completion just about every one of them baring Assault Horizons which I don't view as an Ace Combat game. As such I feel it's important that I do my due diligence and write a review for those who come after me to determine if they wish to purchase this game.I'll start by clarifying that at the time of writing this there is a large amount of review bombing occuring so I will directly be refuting the points being made by the negative reviewers at the moment.1st There are claims this is a low grade console port.It has some alarmingly bad PC setup problems You can't change settings outside of basic flight control settings. IE inverting your controls and slightly altering flight style.2nd This game is meant to be played with a controller just like Darksouls from From Software.This is an arcade plane game. It has always been designed this way. If you expect 100% realism with complete HOTAS support from an Ace Combat game you've missed the point of Ace Combat. 3rd Bandai Namco is remaining silentThis is false they posted on the forums how to fix the problem with HOTAS until they can bug fix.https //steamcommunity.com/games/502500/announcements/detail/1729848148045983457This is the link. Stop screaming that they didn't do anything within 24 hours of release. Gods above.That out of the way my state in the game.Played through the campaign the first time beat it. Working on getting the rest of the planes and their upgradesI have not yet played Multiplayer.Yay Incredibly beautiful graphics. Amazingly optimized I experienced zero frame loss at the most intense moments of gameplay. I had 40 planes on screen at a point lasers flying to and from missiles everywhere. Flares being dumped left and right. No frame loss.Incredibly fun campaign encourages replayability with custom skins and unlocks which become available upon completion of certain requirements. Like previous games it adds aces which you can kill to unlock their special skins. To get them to appear you must perform to your highest in every mission ((Do certain things that enable them to spawn))Really fun high octane fast paced A classic Ace Combat gameReally good controller supportDecent difficulty rampX 02 Wyvern's backNay Feels hand holdy when it comes to landing/refueling... Makes me feel like I'm a baby and takes some of the fun out of it by essentially completing these tasks for me...It's an Arcade game so planes routinely do unrealistic things like high G maneuvers without their pilots passing out.((I was beyond confused the first time I seen an Su 30SM perform an Immelmann turn only to fly straight back down yo yo style before it ramped up to max speed within 2 seconds and juke off screen)) &lt This.Lack of PC settings that we all adore and love.Shortish campaign. 20 missionsIn closing I love this series I like this game. It's a great entry. I intend to keep playing as soon as my work schedule allows me to and my partner stops giving me dirty looks when I drool over the models of some of the planes. If you like Ace Combat Fires of Liberation and more specifically The Belkan War you'll love this game. Just keep in mind this is a console game being brought to PC it was always a console series and expecting their first game outside of Assault Horizons to be perfect is silly. I hope you will find this review helpful and enlightening!,ACE COMBAT™ 7: SKIES UNKNOWN,5,27,3451,592,5

I wish that I had never spent the money on this game in the first place. The developers are clearly money s who want nothing more than to sell copies. Guess what? They are doing a mighty fine job because the hackers that they ban just come back with a chinese account. That in return gives bluehole more money and their creator money to travel the world and be a dumb . You'd be better off playing My Little Pony than this hole of a game.

2/27/2018,0,0,666,Not Recommended,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME... I have played the hell out of this game but as of late it has become nearly impossible to play a round without being killed by a cheater. I remember when i could play TPP in the NA server and not have any problems but then it got worse and i had to move to the EU server again it became unplayable. So my friends and i finally switched to FPP and it was okay for a week or two but then they began taking over those servers.Here's my take on the problem the game has a bp system in place to buy crates that have cosmetic clothing. this clothing can be sold on the steam marketplace for money sometimes in the hundreds so the cheaters will accumulate bp fast buy crates and then open them in hopes of finding a valuable item then they sell the item and purchase a new copy of the game before becoming banned.Bluehole keeps saying the anti cheating measures are a top priority and yet the hacking gets worse and worse and it always seems to coincide with the release of a new crate with new valuable items worth selling. I imagine that if they removed the monetary incentive a lot of the problems would go away with some time. Without crates and items to sell they would be forced to spend their own money to repurchase the game after a round of mass bans. This company had a good thing got rich quick and now they're just riding the microtransaction train to retirement. In short despite the hype you may hear about this game do not purchase it until they come up with a solution for the cheaters or you'll find yourself wishing you could get a refund like myself.

Story looks like typical Tarantino's movie so if you are brain damaged modern retard you will like it. About multiplayer. This is absolutely worst i've ever played better to f*ck a goat than play gta online but much much better to f*ck the creator of this sh*t. I never saw before such a matchmaking system you cant play with your friends as party mode you cant play some simply missions without random f*ggots yes random animals is a really big problem there (The game says that you must play it as 4 what the f*ck should i do if i dont have 2 or 3 more friends?) you cannot hosting new missions and above all its ing infinite loadings. Gameplay? There is no gameplay only the Gayplay with creators in leading roles. P.S. Razrabotchikov v ochko kochergoy ebal.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,51,847,153,1
8/19/2016,0,0,98,Recommended,"EDIT Community is great. Thou some may disagree.It's a truly fun game and one of the few I am actually good at.It's hilarious trying to outsmart your opponent.Some problems with the game is the overpowered survivor perks and overpowered killer perks. Not gonna go into details. Just know that starting new you are at a huge disadvantage but the effort pays off with time. DO NOT SWITCH CHARACTERS OFTEN!!!!!! Just learn to play one character at a time and level them up before you switch. It is 100 times easier to level up one character than have 10 low level characters in the same amount of time. A leveled up character wins more often.It is the only game I can say that the more you play the better it gets.One frustrating thing remains in that a killer that camps a survivor on a hook severly ruins game play. But that has become a rare occurance. And you'll see this is one of the few games ppl say ""GG"" and then wish you good luck in your next game. I love the community.",Dead by Daylight,3,98,978,182,3

11/21/2016,0,0,3928,Recommended,The new update for this game is incredible makes the world look really well detailed and almost real.If you love crafting and building/survival games then this is a must have game! I first tried playing this in its Beta state and it was good but not great had potential but nothing to shout about.A few years have passed and its since its release this game has just got better and better the devs really know how to keep you playing.The whole idea of getting gears and springs for things like hatchs metal doors and sniper rifles is really good too. They started with blueprints and you had to research and gain blueprints for more items but it was more gamble on what you got.The new way of having to find the parts is more realistic and can be harder to get all the high end items early on but not impossible.The world is very detailed and even the grass has been altered so it doesnt take as much computer resources as it used to.Its a highly addictive game with a lot of depth and a lot of things to do.I would recommend this game to anyone into survival post apocalyptic games.,Rust,5,3928,1082,201,5

2/9/2015,0,0,13,Recommended,I have waited for a long time to write this review why? because I didnt think it would be fair to judge a game that is in alpha. It was a rough start. The first couple builds where remarkably dull. I would get on play for a half an hour get my head bashed in by a rock and proceed to spam ALT F4. The game has since then become an uncut gem in my opinon. The UI is amazing and simple to well use and the bugs have for the most part went away. I only have three issues with this game. One grass is all over the goddamn place and the only way to turn it down is through the console (it's not a performance issue I just prefer less grass). Two lag is always present when it comes to PVP which is more than essential to fix in an online only game. And three I find it very hard to find wildlife I dont know if they just dont spawn or what but I might as well be looking for a tumbleweed to eat. To give my final opinion if Facepunch can cut this gem they're looking at my Game of the Year(s).,Rust,3,13,988,206,1

I can't progress in the story mode because of a mission related crash and before this mission playing the story was only possible for about 30 minutes at a time. I can't play GTA Online for more than 10 30 minutes without a crash. I do not experience frame droping stuttering input lag etc. I only get a sudden crash to desktop. I know people who do not have a single issue playing this game but there are far too many people who have purchased GTA V experiencing technical issues just trying to play the game. Reinstalling does not help community fixes do not help it's all on Rockstar now. This game is not worth a purchase until it's playable.edit 6/7/2015I sent in a ticket to Rockstar Support over a month ago I got about seven responses during this time four of these were fix suggestions. The fixes suggested by Rockstar Support were almost always things I had already tried myself (such as lowering settings changing which DirectX the game was running on). There were also suggested fixes that were completely unrelated to the issue I was having. It doesn't seem like they look at the actual info sent to them and just suggest random fixes that have ""worked for other players"". It's been almost two weeks since Rockstar Support has last responded to a message of mine. Maybe the issue is just too complicated but I haven't been able to play this game properly since its release so it doesn't seem acceptable.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,61,1441,258,1

7/14/2017,0,0,9,Recommended,Ok so it seems like all the upsides and downsides vary per user so my tip is if you trust the over all steam reviews for this game D O N T. My gripes with this game is i dont like the religion system and the religion victory is pretty stupid when playing single player although i imagine in multiplayer it could be intresting. I also dont like the animated kids movie feeling the style gives me but the art style they give the map and units i do like. And also many people seem to not like the new governing system. See this is the reason i say they vary because unlike what others seem to think i enjoy the district system. Because it feels more sensible because why would you have baracks in the heart of the city when you can have a whole plot of land for milltary things that do those sorts of things. I also like how workers work by a charge system and work instantly. It makes the beggining of the game feel more rewarding and generaly lessens the hassle of them getting stolen back and forth alot. I also like how you can personalize your government more. another thing i like is that trading in this game is less of a hassle and more fun and rewarding. with cities giving different values and build on their own without the help of workers. Over all i dont think it better than 5 but it is different and not worse so in short. Not fantastic but good.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,3,9,1358,262,3

10/14/2018,3,16,256,Not Recommended,This review is written by a player new to the franchise.TL DR ++Immersive monsters ++Armor customization and selection++Weapon customization+Weapon diversity+Reguarly adding content Grinding Difficulty Port Hub Story Repetitive RNG based elements The Handler HitboxesStoryThe story itself is fairly uninteresting. It serves mostly as a way of introducing the world and the monsters to you. Not at any moment did I sit on the edge of my seat in curiosity for what was to be come next. Therefore the story should not be your reason for playing this game.GameplayI do find the gameplay fairly disappointing mostly because of its lack of accurate hitboxes. It can be a real annoyance at times especially when the monster can one shot you. For example it is not uncommon for you to get charged for as far as I can tell its full damage when you re standing BEHIND your target.The monsters can also often roar CC you and gets quite annoying when it happens multiple times in a row.There s also a random chance of getting stun after being hit which can guarantee your death if you re well unlucky.The targeting system is horrible with M+K. Better off aiming manually all the time.. Flash Pods are absolutely broken and make any monster that flies into the air a joke except situationally metal boii.Walking up a climbable vines/walls makes you climb automatically even if you re using an healing item and therefore canceling it. This can actually kill you when you re accidentally walking into it backwards.You can get pinned down which seems to have no other purpose than killing you by being unable to quickly move out of terrain that damages you.Your attack animation seem to not be accurate in conjunction with the actual hits. For example hitting a monster and seeing your weapon pass the monster entirely can not hit if the monster roars or hits you right after that.Your cat s abilities can often get ignored when called for and calling for them requires you to put away your weapon. This can cause you to have to repeatedly sheathe your weapon to call for it again until he does it.There seems to be no way to guarantee a mount (skillfully) it just seems to be a chance that slowly goes up. Other than that the mounting itself takes no skill after you realise that it's just pressing the button that the right top of the screen tells you to. It also seems that CC chaining monsters is the highest tier gameplay which is fairly disappointing.Disregarded all these imperfections the combat is fairly enjoyable and decent.DifficultyThe game does not pose a challenge skillwise it poses a challenge in preparation and knowledge. The most important to winning the game long term is to upgrade your equipment and weapon. For short term with a specific boss this means having good/suitable Skills bring the effective consumables use a weapon that has a status effect/element that counters it and to obviously know its general moveset.The game s difficulty is mostly just pumping up numbers make monsters hit harder and give them more hp. You generally have the low rank version the high rank version the tempered version... and possibly the arch tempered version in the future (some variations miss the low rank and/or tempered versions). Besides that they recoloured a few bosses and called them different. For example you have the low rank rathalos the high rank rathalos the high rank blue rathalos the tempered rathalos and the tempered blue rathalos. They possibly changed the moveset a tiny bit but I honestly can t tell. The monster variety seems to be too small for a game that focuses on killing monsters and a lot of monsters are very similar. They are supposedly adding frequent free monster updates though which does ease this issue.ImmersionWhat I believe the game excels at most is the immersion. The monsters feel very realistic and it can feel like you re hunting a real dinosa.. monster at least in the beginning. The immersion does wear off fairly quick once you kill the same monster a few times and start to understand its general pattern. The terrain although sometimes somewhat small can feel very immersive because of how distinct the terrain is clearly an eye for detail.The scoutfly system does ruin the immersion a lot though. These shouldn t have been constantly present. There s a mod to remove it though.Lip sync is off not everything is voiced and the lines were not written well.Characters are named by their role. They literally couldn t even name your Handler or any of the expedition leaders.WorldIt is NOT an open world game.The hub is especially badly designed. There s a lot of running around for the occasional micro tasks you should be doing because the locations are not optional you even need to go through a loading screen for one. There s actually a fast traveling mechanic within the hub for covenience but they re not well placed and missing in the most essential spot (the place you spawn...) .There s a countdown after finishing a quest which means you may have not enough time or too much. Should simply have an option to leave whenever you want after finishing.There s no retry option or proper stay as group option (staying as a group in an expedition is not the same especially when everyone has to accept the next quest all over again).MultiplayerHub seems to be mostly for playing for friends and for arena should ve raised the capacity so you can have an active quest board. Also could ve made your hub fill with players and not just purposeless NPCs.The SOS system is nice for getting random people into your hunts although I believe it shouldn t be main co op method.A leaver in your quest cannot be replaced which means if someone is intentionally doing nothing you either can kick him and get no replacement or let him get double value by looting or doing nothing and still getting the boss reward.The multiplayer only scales for solo or multiplayer not depending on the amount of players. Arena is always scaled for multiplayer (unnecessarily).GrindingThe game seems to like grinding... It really really likes grinding... If you re not a fan of it I suggest you better be satisfied with only completing the story line because nearly all the customization requires grinding. The bosses get repetitive and boring quick once you kill it 10x in a row which ruins the immersion a lot. Just so you have a 1% chance of getting that one thing you want.CustomizationThe character customization for your character and your cat are pretty extensive although I did miss the common body height/type modifications.The different armor sets seem very unique and you can switch them around. You can also create interesting Skill combinations.The weapon customization is even more diverse. At higher rank this allows you to create specific weapons to counter specific monsters. UIThat chat bar is bad.The order of consumable items does not seem to consistently save meaning you often have to reorganise it if it s your main way of using items.The game forcefully changes your camera angle when it thinks it locates something important even when it means locating a monster that is infront of you by turning your camera around.SOS quest board search critera does not get saved.Port/OptionsYou can rebind keys for melee and ranged weapons but not for specific weapons. The last should be a thing because the weapons are generally very distinctive and deserve their own kind of keybinds.Quick access menu in combat allows you to sharpen your weapon while it is out but it cannot be done with the normal use item menu (???). Overall I'd not recommend this game at full price unless you're a MH fan. 50% off is probably what I'd consider its value.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,2,256,7677,1311,2

8/12/2018,0,0,127,Recommended,If your computer barely makes it to the minumum specs for this game you're going to have serious issues with preformance. If you are on and NVIDA card you are going to have serious issues because NVIDA put out a garbage driver for this game. If your computer is closer to the reccomended specs and you're not on the newest NVIDA drivers it should run very well. Basically don't try to run this on a budget PC right now. There are also serious issues with connections both to the main servers and to other players. Connecting to other people is a hassle tons of errors when trying to do so and once you are in multiplayer you will get dropped pretty often. If you're centering your experience around playing with others wait until this stuff gets fixed. The story and cuscenes are also garbage. But when it comes down to it they don't matter at all. We're not here to talk we're here to hunt monsters.If these issues are deal breakers for you put this on your wait list and we'll see where some updates get us to. If these aren't deal breakers then buy it. This game is more fun than I've had in years and easily one of my favorite games of all time.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,4,127,1149,216,4

10/30/2017,1,1,208,Not Recommended,"Well here we go...PUBG is a fantastic game at its core but most recently it has been plagued with Bugs in game advertisements (holy you make how much money and you have to advertise your own game IN GAME WTF) and overall bad optimization. I personally have a 1950X GTX 1080 Founders Edition 32 Gb of ram etc... and I cant even get 60 FPS on high settings. I know it is not on my end due to other games running completely fine but this one is just crap. Secondly you add in advertisements for your own game in the game itself. You guys have profited at least 1 million dollars and you had to put in graphics in game that say ""Watch our ESL game coming up (like anybody cares)"". It makes nobody want to watch it and it is just sad that you had to steep this low.Lastly the bugs. Holy the bugs. This game on my computer alone crashes at least 2 3 times per game due to unoptimization and some major bugs Get your together Bluehole and fix this game. Overall I would love to give this game a ""Yes"" recomendation but with the current problems and ads (in a $30 game that we have to pay for) I have to say no.

1/19/2018,0,0,544,Recommended,Dead by Daylight executes the concept of an asymmetrical multiplayer horror game incredibly well with its co op features characters and creepy atmosphere.The game is set within randomly generated arenas with themes such as an asylum scrapyard cornfield and many more maps. There are four survivors one killer. The four survivors need to repair five generators to power the gates which will allow them to escape. The killer needs to find the survivors knock them down put them on hooks and then sacrifice them to their otherworldly gods known as The Entity. From the survivor's perspective it's not as easy as it sounds. It s not just about kick starting generators and running away from the killer. Team work has been set at a high premium as survivors must look out for each other by using medical kits to heal their fellows freeing them from hooks and distract the killer when one's teammate is in danger.I recently obtained the platinum trophy of the game on the PS4 after putting in roughly 400 hours of playtime. I couldn't get enough of it so I decided to buy it on Steam as well. It's one of the best games I've ever played and I've played quite a few throughout my 16 years of gaming (I'm 21). There are some elements that are yet to be resolved. Peer to peer hosting punishes the survivors if the killer's connection is poor and there are minor bugs.The developers of the game keep pushing out updates with new downloadable content bug fixes new features to the game.

The devs novadays...4790K 4.1 MHz OC'ed GTX 970 OC'ed 16GB RAM.I manage to have ton of fps drops (when I play at ""all low"" 1080p I get like 55 75fps. Tried to play 900p. Things got better but now I cannot fkin see anything at mid/long distances).Crashes due to ""video memory loss"" (which actually is quite a lie since u need to INCREASE YOUR SWOP INSTEAD).The game itself is pretty enjoyable but the system requirements &amp lack of optimization ruins it all.And last but not least...

Or maybe you want to drop low key into a group of houses test your luck with the loot RNG and hope you get something to help out mid game. Either way you've got the options to have an enjoyable game. The only issue with this game is that depending on your computer it might take a while for the game to render in the beginning. I imagine this will be fixed as the game progresses.

11/23/2018,0,0,215,Recommended,I was a fan of previous titles in the series playing 3U 4U and Generations on the 3DS for well over 100 hours each.This title improves on the previous in regards to environments movement and graphics along with a fair few quality of life improvements. You don't need to have played the previous titles to enjoy this one.When it comes to monster variety it can be rather lacking. The monsters if does include are destinct but beyond that there are almost no subspecies. There are only 2 ice enemies and a single water enemy meaning you could be working on the same creatures a lot in order to get weapons of the desired element. These issues should improve in time with the addition of free content updates.Paid DLC is purely cosmetic though if you want to alter your characters face/body then you'll need to buy the DLC to do so (the first change is free but that doesn't excuse the terrible excuse to charge you).If you're looking for a co op game then this should get you a huge amount of hours progress is on an individual basis but you can play through missions together (so long as each person has seen the intro cutscene for that story mission start the mission and then leave after the cutscene if you and a friend want to play a mission for the first time).If you don't have people you know who own the game then you can drop into lobbies or search for individual quests to help out others.There are 14 different weapon types each with their own movesets allowing varying playstyles. Weapons have their own upgrade trees which are displayed to the player unlike in previous titles. Performance has been hit and miss on the PC I have an i7 and 1060 (6gb) and usually manage 60fps occasionally dropping under specific circumstance or if kushala daora has 8 tornados going on in its nest. Overall it shouldn't ruin your experience of the game as long as you meet the requirements.

4/18/2015,0,0,4058,Recommended,I'm sure everyone knows what GTA is so I will skip right to it. The PC version is extremely well optimized. I have been running it with barely over minimum system requirements and although the graphics are pretty limited with my crap computer the game still runs smooth. I may update this after I install my new GPU. I love the Self Radio station where it allows you to import your own music playlists into the game and listen to them either as a regular playlist or as an actual radio station with DJ commentary in between songs. The Rockstar editor tool is also amazing allowing you to film your gameplay and edit yourr clips into a movie for uploading on youtube and you can upload your clips directly from the in game menu. You can seemlessly switch between using your game pad and your keyboard/mouse without needing to change any settings. This helps with navigating menus and editing your Rockstar Editor clips. I can't say much about the graphics for reasons I have already stated but i'm told it's amazing with a proper GPU. If you don't already have it on your console I highly recommend it.That said if you already own this game on a console I would not recommend buying it on PC. The main reason I say this is because honestly the PC community just really sucks. You can easily spend 20 30 mins just trying to get people to join a job. And then if you are lucky enough to get people to join chances are someone is going to quit as soon as you start it. If they don't quit as soon as you start the job don't get too excited because they are probably just trying to waste your time so they will wait until you are almost finished and then quit or fail on purpose. To top it off it seems like 3/4 of the PC community are communists. What I mean here is on the heists missions you have say 4 5 setup missions that you have to complete first before you get to the main mission and you do not get paid for those. So the way Rockstar has it set up is that the host of the mission gets 55% of the reward because the host completed all the setup first. Each person who joins on the final mission gets 15% but the game allows you to adjust the take if you want. Well most people will demand at least 20% if not 25%. If you pay them 25% you also get 25% which means all your work is really for nothing you would be better of doing regular missions. If you pay them 20% that means you are getting 40% of the cut for doing 80% of the work. If you don't raise their cut they are probably going to quit as soon as you start the mission. If you do raise their cut you are getting screwed and they are probably still going to quit. I'm not sure what makes these people think they are entitled to 20 25% of the heist rewards they are only participating in a small part of the overall job and even at the default 15% reward for them they are already making 3x the amount that they would get from a regular mission.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,4058,2907,562,5

You will encounter both adults who will swallow their microphones when you kill them and produce strange sounds and kids who will swallow their microphones when you kill them and produce strange sounds.&gt The game is full of skilled marksmen. For examples there will be situations when you will be shot from 5 km with a shotgun by a pro player called chingchang997456&gt The gameplay is full of unexpected situation like cars who can knock down fences being blocked by a plastic chair in the middle of the street.&gt The game is a part of E sports. Just check what team is the best at using medical in the electric field who doesn't do too much anyway.&gt A lot of weapons even if most of them are broken and you will see players carrying one of the 5 actually working guns. Why to shoot someone 10 times with a pistol when you can easly shoot him 1 time with an AK because is ing normal in a survival game to outstand 10 pistol shots.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,379,1417,261,1

I have played it for 4 days now and even though I am not as good as those who have been playing for a while I have been able to win 2 times. I have read many other reviews and have read about many people getting banned from forums for speaking their minds and even the game itself for breaking the no stream sniping rule. I will continue to support this game until I am banned for stream sniping as getting banned for this without proof seems to be a common thing. If I am banned for that then I will most likey update my review but so far I love the game and I am excited to see where they take the game. There are micro transactins in the game but there are so many other games out there that have them as well so I cant see why its any different in this situation.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,109,831,169,4

Survival from the elements is quite easy in the game. It is survival from the other players that make this game difficult. If you are alone in the game you will have to be hidden all the time if people see you they will almost always come kill you for your stuff or to simply eliminate you as a threat.

Since it's early access there are a lot of bugs but nothing that makes the game unplayable. Would like to see a spectator mode for friends that aren't playing/in your group. Or a larger group. Like 6 people.I'm terrible at shooting and worse at aiming but I still find the game enjoyable.EDIT The game is now no longer Early Access. However it's still riddled with bugs. Probably even more so than when it was in Early Access. This game is 100% not ready to be official but it was only pushed forward to try and make more money despite the game not being finished.Wouldn't recommend until these issues are fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,251,706,128,1

7/20/2015,1,1,614,Recommended,To start this review off if you guys think Gta V is not worth buying because of the whole summer sale thing. Here's some news. Thats over! Its been over for awhile now and the sale for it wasent bad you were still paying 60 bucks for it and a free 20 doller shark card. So if you dident like it at that time you could maybe like rockstar not adding a free 20 doller shark card and maybe make you buy it yourself. )Now about Gta VPro's Huge area to explore! Gta V is very huge and highly detailed you wont get this if you have it on low settings that means you wont be able to see the small detailes. That dosent mean you wont be mindblown by the huge area's and even the underwater area to explore! Very fun! Even if you have Gta V on the low settings that wont mean that you're not gonna have fun with single player and online. Amazing single player! Gta V singleplayer just took the Grand Theft Auto franchise to awhole new level with just how much you can do now in singleplayer with heist mind blowing missions side missions and the amazing cutscenes! Gta Online! The amazing online mode is back and is just amazing. You get to buy amazing sport cars and just random other cars along with some planes and choppers with some boats too. Besides all these amazing things to buy off of your phone but this isent all. You got missions and heist both really fun to do along with the amazing feeling of finishing a mission and getting your wonderful pay of a load of cash for your spending spree of ammo and at the strip club! Make it rain. Free Dlc! So Rockstar gives us free dlc such as adding new clothes guns and cars to online also giving you the cars for free in singleplayer but the clothes and gun arnt free. For online nothings free such as you cant get the cars guns and clothes for free but at least they arnt making you buy the dlc then buy the cars and such like some other games do.Con's Hackers online. Now we all know about hackers being everywhere online but. but. This problem can be avoided by getting some friends or playing by yourself in a invite only session and that isent bad its pretty fun! Gta V has only been out for 3 months at the moment. So the pc version of Gta V has only been out for 3 months at the moment as we know and that dosent mean the game is gonna be amazing right now but we most likely are gonna have a long time till Gta 6 comes out so that means the game is gonna improve more and more over time.Overall Gta V is a amazing game and Im sure that the game will get better and better overtime with more and more free dlc and more updates.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,614,2579,504,5

It is amazing.So you are placed in a world with just a rock a torch and a few bandages.Your aim is to survive but to do so you must gather wood craft build a house and be careful of who you trust.You can raid peoples houses or just attack them on sight. You can be hidden in the mountains or be out in the open field.Whatever you do and how you survive is up to you. This game may take a while to get used to but it depends on how fast you learn. You want to know and understand the map as soon as you can to avoid getting lost. Trust me... getting lost is horrible.Yes this game has had its bad moments such as the server DDosers but this game is great and the developers have done a great job with this game.

There is always something new in this game. Just when you think you have seen it all the developers throw something new in it. Different game modes with different matchmaking settings. This game is really worth the money. Also the DLCs are worth buying even if just to support the developers. I would definitely recommend this game.

6/21/2017,0,0,126,Recommended,To all the people hating on Take Two for taking down the mod menu support You are all a bunch of hypocrites! I use to play this game online quite a bit and just about every time I would go online there would be someone using a mod menu to screw other players over. They would use these menus to gain an advantage to drop themselves money for things that took us legit players a long time to earn to kill other players to put ridiculous constant bounty's on other players spawning vehicles that they should not have this is to name a few things that the mod menus did to ruin the online experience. Now that the menus are gone the online world should be a much better place to play this game with friends. Does it suck that you can't use them in single player anymore.... sure. However this does not make this game a bad game nor does it take away from the accomplishments that GTA V has made since it's release oh so long ago. GTA V is a great game and will go down in history as one of the most in depth fun crazy adventure open world games of all time. If you are salty about them getting rid of something that was ruining the online play for most people then you do not deserve to play this game in the first place.

4/15/2018,0,0,1274,Recommended,Let's see. Almost 1000 hours into this game i am ready to give my opinion. 1. This game needs to be optimized as soon as possible. The lower limit of the fps can go as low as 45fps while i'm playing on low to medium settings on a GTX 1060. It is annoying and lethal to both my mouse and computer table.2. Server is always busy and SEA is somehow laggier than AS when i live near Singapore.3. SEA's server still doesn't have TPP yet after so long. WHY DO YOU FORSAKE US? WE PAID FULL PRICE FOR THE GAME AS WELL.4. The hacker issue has subsided a little bit as compared to the month of January and February. During those two months out of 10 games 8 of them was infested with hackers.5. Region lock China.Still I'd recommend PUBG simply because it is still fun despite all its flaws.

2/24/2017,0,0,37,Recommended,I've noticed the majority of the reviews are hating on the AI and not liking the art style. While I have to say personally I like the art style I get it isn't for everyone. Especially since it's a lot more cartoony compared to the other games. But I'll start with my thoughts then adress the AI complaints. Pros Districts add a nice micro manage to the game with series benifits when maximized. Ramped up barbs make the early game much better in my opinion The new policy system is much better Tech tree is better Reduction of wonder powers helped with balance in both mid and early game Religion Victory making religion semi viable The art style is nice in my opinion Penalties for going to war The housing system helps keep extreme agression at bay (I've always been more of a tall player anyways so I don't mind the more restricted city building) The seperation of leader and country bonuses is very nice Cons Religion is still pretty much useless. However if 1 player decides to focus on it then others are forced to in order to not lose which is nice Learning curve is much steeper in this game (although this is not a bad thing. It just means newer players are going to struggle more) Penalties for war are very harsh and often shut down the losing member(s) of the war Diplomicy is fairly weak. There's not a world congress however this has been adressed by the devs. They're waiting to see how things develop in the games playerbase to see how they want to gear congress Ramped up barbarians can be extremely punishing if you aren't prepared The housing system is also very limiting (also not a bad thing. However due to the map generations sometimes you end up with terrible cities because you needed a resource that you cant have access to near a mountain river or coastline.)Okay. For the most part I feel those are all pretty straight forward. As for background on me I have a few hundred hours in Civ V and have looked a lot into this game beyond just the 30+ hours I have in it.As for the AI problems. Yes I will agree that the AI is terrible in this game. However the AI was terrible in Beyond Earth and Civ V. Even with all 3 expansions in Civ V the AI is pretty trash. They're pushovers that declare war on you for little to no reason. The AI has never been good. I understand everyone is upset that the AI is bad but it's always been bad. Play this game with friends and you have an entirely different experience. Players will always beat AIs in these kinds of games for enjoyability. Trust me.This game isn't bad by any means. I personally think it's a step up from Civ V especially now that there have been enough updates to bring some of the basic functions back (like city naming queues etc.).Mid game got sped up by quite a lot Late game toned down and Early game is much cleaner in my opinion. Now we don't have 3 or 4 eras of mid game which to some might feel weird but I like the quicker feel of the game.All in all this is still a pretty good game. It isn't quite to level as full expansion Civ V but it's on the path to it. It has a lot of neat features and once you've learned how to utilize them it works out to be a very fun game.,Sid Meier’s Civilization® VI,3,37,3161,600,3

Ive played GTA V for most of the time on my PS4 but then switched to the PC version just for the very reason of available mods like the LSPDFR mod. Now that they have decided to completely destroy modding by filing a lawsuit against Open IV which is basically needed to create mods that game is dead for me. The Multiplayer part of it is just filled with hackers all the way and the prices for cars planes and so on are just ridiculious. Anyone who is still thinking about buying this game should stay away from it. It will keep you busy for probably 30+ hours but then without mods and new things to try out you will loose interest in it pretty fast.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,10,753,147,1

4/1/2017,0,0,254,Recommended,"What we have here is the culmination of work done by Brendan Greene through his work on his Dayz mod Arma 3 and H1Z1 all of which i played many times. After the slew of trash ""AAA"" games over the past few years it was refreshing to buy a game (for not 40) and watch the hours played grow much more than some games. When it first released there were indeed problems i remember the sound was properly ed and the optimisation was a true flaw but having put the graphics on very low i could easily play it with friends and it was a good time. As extremely sizeable patches came out Very low changed to low and low changed to medium. Optimisation is working and the game as a whole is getting even better than at its release. The gunplay from day 1 is still next to none and the mechanics that are still being largely expanded upon are brilliant. Then comes the reason recent reviews are mixed. Apparently Brendan promised no microtransactions until out of alpha and with an update added invitational crates you could earn for battlepoints but could open with a key. My favourite quote some guy in the forums said was something along the lines of ""they are milking us dry with all these microtransactions!!"" which i laughed at as it is the most optional thing i have seen. I really couldn't care about cosmetic microtransactions i firmly believe i owe it to the team for making such a good game. Now if they started adding meaningful content behind a paywall THEN we have problems but being able to earn crates i can sell for 2 just benefits me.

10/16/2016,0,0,1553,Recommended,Rust is a survival game created by Facepunch Studios. Inspired by games like DayZ Minecraft and Stalker Rust aims to create a hostile environment in which emergent gameplay can flourish. The aim of the game is to survive. To do this the player should gather resources. Hitting a tree with a rock will give you wood hitting a rock with a rock will give you rock and ore. You can then craft a hatchet from the wood and rock allowing you to gather faster. You can go out and hunt a variety of wildlife such as boars chickens rabbits bears wolves and deer. Once you have killed an animal you can butcher it to gather its meat and skin. You can craft a fire using wood and cook the meat inside the fire. Then you can eat. You face two major dangers in game. Rust is a multiplayer game so there will be other players trying to survive in the same way that you are. Unfortunately for you they can find you kill you and take your stuff. Fortunately for you you can kill them and take their stuff. Or maybe you can make friends and help each other survive. Rust s world is harsh so you might need to make friends to survive. The environment is not kind. Bears and wolves will chase and kill you. Falling from a height will kill you. Being exposed to radiation for an extended period will kill you. Starving will kill you. Being cold will kill you. I will kill you ),Rust,5,1553,1356,259,5

And considering there are both 1st and 3rd person viewing you end up with so many ways to aim and move. There's holding right mouse button (focused hipfire?) and there's a full click (toggle full ADS). I'm not going to judge what is better compared to say battlefield style but I just don't want to learn a new system.

3/9/2015,0,0,2,Not Recommended,Trust me I want to say this is a good game. New Rust sucks in every way a video game can suck. Lag missing textures broken gameplay mechanics that used to work no servers in my local area and the developers know this and have known for years. Updates only seem to break the game even more. Trees give little to no wood. Wood piles are rare. Stone is common. You need absurd amounts of wood to use that stone. Do you have a house foundation? Good! No you have to find blueprints for walls. Did you find a generated structure? Well run because radiation will kill you within 20 seconds now. Did you build a house with a door? By the time you get on tommorow someone has killed you and taken all your food. Speaking of food there are little to no animals. But when you do find a pack of dear boars birds a lone bear or a pack of wolves. They can outrun or kill you. Old rust fixes this. No lag or missing textures. Good gameplay. And plenty of servers. So play old rust or you will bust a hole in your fancy gaming cpu.,Rust,1,2,1016,200,1

Additionally requirements say 6GB ram? lol nope the game itself takes at least 8 9 gb on mine so in my experience you would like to use a 16GB Ram as mine and run nothing else at the time (oh and you will still fps lag guess what).

Too fast is not good tho.I had fun playing it but I dont think many will... you need to get into a group of players. Late night raiders take out bases when their is nooone there to defend.

Multiplayer is not doing so well right now. For singleplayer quests it is best if everyone takes the mission at first gets to the cutscene then leaves (not abandones) the quest which then lets the mission be able to queue with up to four players (really dumb as it breaks the immersion much more to have to do that than just having four hunters there).

I have liked every GTA story so far this is no exception. The map is huge. There are a variety of things you can do here just like anyother GTA.GTA Online Heists are great. I wish they could add more. 5 is not enough. Regular missions are decent. Apart from doing missions you can race deathmatch all those things which are fun. New content continously being added.Cons If you are unlucky you end up in a server with a hacker and all kinds of bad will happen to you. The anti cheat system isnt that strong if it exists in the first place. Every morning I get up run this game click ""multiplayer"" go to work and by the time I am back from work in the evening multiplayer still wouldnt be loaded.

This is coming from someone who has played both online (console) and offline (with mods on PC).I bought GTA 5 on PC to use mods only offline being fair to those in online lobbies.I say no to this simply for the singelplayer as myself i like modding OFFLINE! and creating custom cars characters etc. I don't bother with online because of overpriced cars clothes and other unrealistic material. I love GTA 5 but the updates are so annoying especially for a person like me who wants to mod just offline and have fun alone. Sadly ""take two"" is trying to take mods out and force us to go online. This is really absurd considering that mods keep the offline portion of gta alive and well at this point i think i just might uninstall this game and forget about it at this point. Sad to say but i see Red Dead 2 being another opportunity for ""take two"" and their silly money hungry antics. Note that this coming from a person who played online on xbox also so i know the struggle of grinding constantly online to get money that goes very quickly just to keep doing heists that don't even pay much (take two's mission for shark cards). This is why i came to PC to play this game and be left alone offline but unfortunately this didn't work. i never played gta online with mods on PC because it's unfair to players just having fun in lobbies.

Then add the just disastrous decision to have three half baked characters instead of one good one and all the little glitches like quest targets disappearing behind walls. Story is boring as hell compared to older GTAs (e.g. Vice City). For me the second worst GTA of all time (with San Andreas still number one). And instead of a real DLC such as ""The Ballad of Gay Tony"" for GTA IV they keep adding online modes.Oh and by the way the ""world record"" on the airport race is 0.170 seconds at the time of this review.

It is easy to get frustrated especially early on when it looks like there are only a few activities and you re getting constantly stomped by people with better toys in the open world. Don t give up steal cars and rob mini marts. Buy guns or cars to do missions or race then property. Don t get lured away from the goal by the icing (clothing haircuts tattoos custom paint and neon kits on starter cars). I d rather be the worst dressed guy killing your faces any day.

If the game was more difficult it would not be a problem but what the game does is a mix of broken hit boxes hitting you out of animations where you are recovering from being hit and constant chain stunning make it so that you often die immediately even if you do nothing wrong.

And that is ultimately so I could have fun. Indeed this is no longer possible for those that don't particularly care for the online because Take Two Interactive wants to squeeze enough money out of consumers' pockets (even after the vast majority had purchased this game three separate times). It didn't take long for me to lose interest in the Online aspect of this game seeing as it was absolutely full of hackers and microtransactions so I thought ""Hey I can have just as much if not even more fun just modding the singleplayer. Because you know I along with millions of people that pushed this game into its legendary status throughout the years want to have fun."" Not only is the cease and desist towards the largest modding tool used in the Grand Theft Auto series an absolute kick in the teeth for those that just wanted to enjoy your game Take Two but it's a massive hideously enormous absolute kick in the teeth to the modders that spent countless hours so us singleplayer users could have some fun of our own often without any financial backing or support. All of this restriction on mod develepors and consumers of the admittedly brilliant and phenomenal singeplayer experience just so a single company can grab as much as they can from people's wallets (despite GTA V already being the fourth and nearly third best selling game of all time) is downright shameful.No more Take Two games for me until you get your together.

But when you get into a real fight or into a raid your heart will pump harder than ever before. There is no other game that can deliver it better. When you win that fight and secure loot there is no other game that can deliver that good feeling. The game can be played in many ways and all should be tried by you because the are so different. Rust is fixing more and more of its issues but many still remain tho. It is walking in the right direction very fast. Pick up the game now because its on its way to full release.The community could be better but on the other hand theres a lot of good guys out in the rust world aswell just like in real life theres a lot of greedy bastardsEveryone should try solo playing. its the ultimate rust experience and delivers the most dangerous hardest experience and gives the the biggest adrenaline kicks in my opinion.But also try playing in a group here teamwork comes into play which is both fun and challenging10/10 best spent money in my life,Rust,5,935,1141,215,5

The game is good there are a few things that need to be fixed for example...Long laoding screens when joining games joining a game then crashing and after a game you can't proceed to do a next round without starting at step 1...A part from that it's all good. People need to expect bugs and glitches not every game is perfect after all these games can take up to years of work. The character customization is amazing (Not sure why every character is refeering to left 4 dead 1/2 though).

Looks amazing.Surroundings are well done no copy pasta ea time or wherever you look.Some complain (even still) its a bad port tbh there are worse ports out there Aswell it cost some pretty penny but id say its deff worth.Kb/ mouse default layout is horrid so that needs some adjusting It does have controller support aswell.( the game is defaulted for controller settings so if your kb/m adjust your settings in options).Other than that About the bad port thing Some ppl are never happy or can be satisfied for me i enjoy the game alot You can do whatever you want regards gear options ( go for looks or go for 'meta' builds or thinker something for yourself you like). Ranged / melee its all there. 14 weapons with ea their own playstyle(s). Pretty much easy to learn hard to master conceptAnyway i enjoy the game it plays really nice its my 1st Monster hunter game Got 2 saves 1 for ranged only and 1 for melee only and the playstyles are really diffrent. ( Monsters react diffrent if your close or if you are far as in diffrent movesets which is nice.)IF you like grinding this game is great and very rewarding.So many options and ways to play it is really nice! )IF you like hugging a piggy thats a option too..

There is a load of content that could be made for this game but the devs are working on the most basic functionality each week which is of course very exciting.Those who do not know Rust is made by Facepunch the company that is well known for creating Garry's Mod and is therefore lead by Garry Newman who I have full trust in in creating a full survival game sandbox that is constantly innovating and bringing out cool new features.You can build a house hunt chickens for wolf meat craft weapons shoot bows. It is more than a PvP game the whole thing is a social experiment!

4/17/2014,0,0,137,Not Recommended,"As of this moment I do not recommend you to buy this game. The main reason is because how the developers are treating the development phase of this game. Apparently they sphagetti coded this game and now they are stuck in it trying to rewrite every line. But they are so slow that they are posting updates about such simple things so simple that they should have done it since the start as every large scale program should.But when you ask for serious content and updates fanboys will say ""THIS IS APLHA THEN DONT BUY!!!"". Well my friends Rust has sold more than 1 million copies. I am sure that 20 million dollars are very sweet how about adding more members to the team? 19 million dollars not enough for you? Apparently not.It is even funny that Garry is asking players to create and add objects to the game so that they they don't have to bother with that. And then Garry cries about the fact that item designs in the game seem like out of different people's hands. That is what is gonna happen if you use icons from google searches. Maybe spare a few thousands dollars and hire another designer? You must really need that 20 million $ man.About the gameplay. Get ready to see tons of hackers on official servers ruining your game. Fanboys will say ""Go play on moderated servers!!!!!"" These guys cannot even manage their official servers with moderators. The game needs more optimising to run smoother and more options to build yet the last few months didn't change much. This game needs a generous owner who is willing to spend a small portion of what he earned to make it better. This way it won't achieve much. It is a shame actually.",Rust,1,137,1641,298,1

4/27/2014,0,0,71,Recommended,Honestly this is a good game. Not a great game but a good game. I have put in about 33 hrs and for the first half of that everything felt like a fresh experience. Then for the second half everything became kinda stale. Yes this is in beta so of course things will change and then experiences will most definitely change as well. I was gonna write a legthy review but decided against it. Theres really not a lot to say anyway. This game has potential to be an excellent survival game. They did away with the zombies so now its supposed to just be survival. However after a short amount of time playing you will have everything you need and in vast quantities. So its no longer about survival but pure PVP. Which is fun to a degree. But thats not why I bought into this game. I dont wanna log into a server just to go hunt down other players everytime. This gets old. But so does logging in just to build up your base a little better to prevent it from getting raided again. So roaming the map to raid a base and kill other players is the only real way to have fun. Other games in this genre have this same exact issue. When it comes down to it these games lack objectives. Something you can strive for and in the end get that reward that will make that once tedious task now bareable. Its all a vicious cycle. I believe that the devs could have a gem of a game here. But its still lacking in the feature department as of now. Im sure they have tons of features and ideas they want to add but at the moment I feel what we have may be what the core gameplay is going to be and thats it. Im gonna recommend this game based soley on the fact that it is fun and that it is still in development. So the devs could add some much needed features to spice up the gameplay and give it that zip that it needs.,Rust,3,71,1797,355,3

6/20/2014,0,0,54,Recommended,It's a fun game but definitely still in alpha. Unfortunately it has the problem that most games of this type do and that is people randomly killing on sight (KOS) but until there is some way to make PvE enjoyable then that's pretty much all the people who've been playing for longer will be interested in doing. That said if you have friends to play with this game can be quite enjoyable just don't get upset when you get shot in the back or your base gets raided and everything you spent hours collecting is now gone.Also the experimental branch looks very interesting and promising and I can't wait to see where they go with this game.,Rust,3,54,637,117,3
10/31/2016,0,0,345,Not Recommended,If you want to play this game off line It is amazing and so much fun.Now the online is a pile of you will easy spend more time waiting and loading then playing the game. Loading screens are about 1.5 3 mins long even with a M.2 SSD. Random disconnects form the server when your internet was going strong.And when you disconnect instead of trying to reconnect right away and save you some time it makes you wait for singel player to load up before you can then start loading the online again.You would think after they announced bringing huge updates to online as the next GTA wont be out for many years they would of fixed the server problems but almost no sign of improved since launch andd dont expect any,Grand Theft Auto V,1,345,707,132,1

1/2/2015,0,0,240,Recommended,Love how high you are allowed to create buildings and structures and the fact you can build on bodies of water! Once you learn the controls and kit and teleport commands the world is your oyster. Hopefully you get on a server with helpful people or play with friends. You need friends in a game like this otherwise you better be careful how much you player kill or karma will come back bigtime. Some of the pitfalls (at least to some) are you cannot dig underground the zombies are gone in rust (not sure about legacy people can and will break into your base kill you and take your stuff (happens often if you do not fortify) gathering is tedious if not on an excess gather server and gathering supplies in the dark is downright dangerous because you cant see the bears and wolves until its too late. Still for all its faults Rust is a great game highly addicting and time consuming. Many of the things which make it most annoying are also its best attributes you have to build elaborate bases dummy bases sniper towers and use friends to keep from being raided. Learning HOW to outsmart the other players is half the battle.,Rust,5,240,1125,206,5

If you have it on PC nothing they improved was needed and it was all done better by way of existing mods than they did here. Way to go for my PS4 playing friends though. They're all really excited for it to be coming back to a new generation.It doesn't look that much better in fact with the mods I already had on Skyrim this looks worse now so graphics aren't a reason to switch over.The mods are delivered via a Bethesda account rather than Steam Workshop. Not hard to use but a pain to log in when you can't paste into the password box and a completely unnecessaey change outside of folks on consoles.Using mods disables achievements. Adding hunger cold and other mods that make the game more difficult shouldn't treat you like you're cheating. I used one cheese mod on Skyrim a chest full of building materials for Hearthfire everything else I added was a realism mod.

7/20/2017,0,0,158,Recommended,Incredibly fun and intense game that keeps you on edge the entire duration of the match. Battlegrounds has managed to find a balance between the realism of Arma and the silliness of H1Z1 which I believe makes it significantly superior to the aforementioned games. I cannot wait for the new update that's going to add vaulting and climbing mechanics which brings me to my next point This game is insanely good considering it's only in early access and the developers have a goal of releasing it by the end of 2017 giving them plenty of time to work with. The only improvement that I can genuinely suggest that doesn't have anything to do with the actual gameplay is a fix for the network optimization as well as the game's resource intensive nature. It by no means requires a high end PC yet it tends to have poor FPS at times. The lag in the game is unbearable at times even going as far as not letting you enter buildings because you simply get teleported back out once you're in due to network issues. But both these issues can easily be overlooked due to the development status of the game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,158,1093,199,4

I must enlist help on this crusade to rid this infestation. Day 11 I have enlisted the help of a small group of hired guns to assist in purging them off this island.Day 14 The numbers begins to tip in my favour. However thgoogle translateey have begun mimicing me and my group. I lay awake at night restless they are learning. Day 18 They have managed to surround a few of my men today. They surrounded them and began chantting as they all ran at them at once. The survivers were found huddled around each other. They had all gone insane as if they had seen a monster. they kept whispering ""China number one"". Day 22 I only have a few men left. Most were swarmed others deserted. The population of the filth is all but unknown now I fear I won't be able to stop them.Day 31 A new threat has emerged from the depths of the hive. They're apex predators their aim is unparalleled their instincts heightened. Capable of seeing a target hundreds of meters away and through several walls. My men have started calling them ""Bing Bongs.""Day 35 The Bing Bongs are relentless they have slaughtered many of my men. I witnessed them slaughter their own kind without a second thought.Day 37 The number of Bing Bongs is skyrocketing I have had to call in some help. BattleEye Has launched a large strike on a few of the Bing Bongs central hive's but will it be enough to hold them back? only time will tell. Day 38 I have encountered a few Bing Bongs since the BattleEye strike however they are weakened. Their aim has being completetly impaired they just lean slightly and shoot at nothing. Perhaps they were somehow being augmented in the hives? Further reasearch must be done. Day 41 Another Bing Bong has been spotted today. I stood in awe as It ran faster than my men in a UAZ ( Ulyanovsky Avtomobilny Zavod ). He must have been running atleast 50m/s. my men they did not make it. Day 42 I encountered another enhanced Bing Bong. It moved so fast I was bearly able to keep track of It. It was unarmed but It would blink behind me then punch then run all the while It was taunting me laughing at me. As I land the killing blow It screams ""CHINA NUMBER ONE!"" I will not be able to sleep tonight. Day 44 I have been unable to sleep for three days due to the ominous threat of the Bing Bongs is to much. BattleEye Plans to attack the hives again tonight maybe I will be able to rest for a few hours. Day 45 No sign of the Enhanced Bing Bongs I remain vigilant.Day 46 I encountered a Bing Bong. The BattleEye strike must have worked It is unable to aim but It remains aware of my postition. A well placed nade kills It. Day 47 One of my men managed to record inside one of the hives. It appears they willingly accept a parasite that enhances their abillities beyond their biological limits. The BattleEye Strike only seems to kill the infected hosts and the surviving parasites morph and adapt to resist the BattleEye strikes. My hands haven't stopped shaking since I watched the recording. Day 54 The Infestation has spread they managed to get aboard a plane sent to resupply me and my men. Hives have begun sprouting up in Miramar the local goverment was fast acting and built a wall to enclose the area. All surviving civilians have been evacuated. Day 55 My men and I have left Erangel to deal with the threat in Miramar. The Bing Bongs here are different. Civilians saying that they witnessed a single Bing Bong kill as much as 30 people through walls buildings and hills. If this is true me and my men are walking into a slaughter. Day 58 The stories are true nowhere is safe. A plane with 92 men on it was flying into Miramar to provided aid for the Cleanse. The moment it was above the Hives all 92 men died they weren't even able to jump out of the plane. Thats when I saw it this filthy Bing Bong Feasting on a succulent chicken dinner amidst the mass grave of dead men. Day 59 BattleEye launches Its first strike on Miramar. Everyone is praying the strike works. Day 60 The strike worked but the Bing Bongs parasite is so volatile It has already adapted. Day 61 Following the recent strike many men have abandond the fight to cleanse Miramar and Erangle and moved to fortnite. I refuse to give up someone must remain to cleanse. Day 64 BattleEye has begun launching small strikes in rapid succession atempting to adapt as fast as the Bing Bong Parasite does. Day 68 The Rapid adaption is working small waves of Bing Bongs are being cleansed each time. This might be enough to ralley some men back to the Cleanse.Day 71 The number of Bing Bongs is decreasing however their lesser weakened forms still infest both Erangle and miramar. They seem to be operating as small guerilla groups hiding in the darkness ready to pounce on my men whilst they loot for supplies. We will have to be more cautious to avoid further casualties.Day 75 Me and my men have been tasked with cleansing Erangle as Miramars infestation population remains on the decline. Day 82 It appears that only 9% of the original infestation remains.The chanting of ""China Number One"" can be heard faintly at night.Day 95 Its been two weeks without a single Enhanced Bing Bong sighting. I have planned to take a large portion of the men I have to Sanhok the Bing Bong homeland. hopefully we will be able to wipe them out. Day 96 The island of Sanhok apears to be a training ground for the Bing Bongs we will be doing further research and reconnaissance onto what else they use the island for tomorrow.Day 97 Todays reconnaissance has provided alot of information as to what else this island is used for. They have large areas dedicated to growing farming and processing rice. This must be how they feed such a large population so effectively. Salt farms were also discovered along many of the islands coastlines. With a supply this large I can understand how they remain so volitile and aggressive all the time. Day 98 Great strides have been made in eradicating the indigenous population of Bing Bongs. I think my job is nearly done here. Day 99 Recently an Uknown corporation has been selling my men a pass. Its a list of diffrent things they want done on the island cleanse 100 Bing Bongs nade a few burn a couple et cetera et cetera. But after completing a few task they are rewarded with some Gucci clothes. Day 100 small pockets of the weakened Bing Bongs still inhabit Erangle and miramar. I continue to Purge and Cleanse as much as I can but due to the low numbers of weak Bing Bongs I find myself often waiting hours before encountering enough of them to retreat and resupply.After 100 Days of Cleansing I have accumulated enough chicken dinners to feed a large camp of vegans for a lifetime. 5/7 game would play 100 more days.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,2739,7108,1303,5

12/28/2017,0,0,514,Recommended,So its about the time I give one of the best games of all time (in my opinion) a PROPER review for the game I have the most hours in. It beaten GMod in terms of hours. JeSus christ i have 500+ hours on this game. That's half a thousand hours.I am a level 131 with alot of things. I own every single gun and I own the best cars fully tuned. I own all properties (apart from the yacht). I REALLY enjoy this game.Scroll down for TL DR!Grand Theft Auto V (abreviated as GTA 5) is a game where you're a criminal you have a gun you kill people killing people feels good you rob a store it goes wrong end up at a hospital types of game essentially what I called a open world crime shooter.But this series has always been the grand father of this kind of series so it exels at it making a normally boring situation in real life like driving at slow speeds in heavy trafic funny as hell with funny dialogue from the people in the car and the ads on the radio. And sometimes a random firefight will start out because a random NPC got bored.So lets talk about the driving and I got a slight point to make about the driving.GTA has always had arcady driving but GTA IV (GTA 4) ruined that by making the cars feel heavy which is a nice thing but it seems to have made everyone forget the original driving of GTA. Fast and arcady.So with the arcade mind style the driving is great its not too hard to control but not too easy.However the vehiculs have weight and it still reminds you that a truck isnt gonna turn instantly theres still some bits of realistic driving that rarely kick in but those are usually when you wanna play the game as a normal person not a psycopath that can carry a minigun and a rocket launcher in his backpocket like it was nothing.The shooting is awesome Its like Max Payne 3 but less gory.Also unlike previous GTA games theres this infinite pocket system to re iterate once you buy a gun from the same type (i.e 2 assault rifles) you keep both instead of dropping the one you had. Its a nice touch and allows you to switch playstyles quickly.There's a nice selection of weapons and there are many guns of the same type. If I remember correctly there are (Counting the online only weapons)14 pistols12 SMGS / LMGS8 ARs / Assault Rifles5 Sniper Rifles18 Melee Weapons7 Heavy Weapons7 Explosives Next up the world.In my opinion this IS the best part of Grand Theft Auto exploring the open world.GTA 5 is located in the fictionnal city of Los Santos a parody of Los Angles in the fictionnal state of San Andreas which is the name of a previous GTA game and a parody of California.Now what makes this world so fun to be in is that it feels alive. If you go in the forest you can hear the sound of distant bikes and the sounds of the local wildlife like wolves and deers.Or if your in the city you're gonna hear the noises of the people around you drinking a coffee maybe talking about that one time where they hit a dog or talking to a female hoping they can get in the girls pants but miserably failing.And did I say the world is HUGE? There's a ocean lakes forests a desert villages. a city abandonned buildings etc. A few days ago I even found locations I didn't even know they were there. There's alot of locations that can make a unscripted police chase feel like a scripted police chase (in a good way). When running from the cops there are so many locations to drive through to lose them or places to hide in. Did I mention there's an entire sewer system under Los Santos?And for the last few things for single player there are mods. I don't really know how to mod the game as I think the game is fantastic as it is already but all I know is that you need a program called OpenIV and a thing called scripthook. And pretty sure you gotta backup your files and stuff incase there's an update. If you don't enjoy a broken scripthookAnd now for a part of GTA where some people enjoy like me myths.GTA pleases original bigfoot hunters from the san andreas days but I wont talk much on it.And now for the infamous Online mode.To be honest its not as bad as everyone thinks well in my opinion.You start off as a person who just arrived in Los Santos (your own character mind you but hes silent so....) and talking to Lamar another resident in Los Santos as he picks you up at the airport he gives you a gun and you get the option to do the tutorial or not.From here you make your own story.From being a hobo on the street to being a criminal mastermind owning illegal buisnesses there's alot of stuff to do in GTA Online.And there are where the issues kick in.To do buisnesses and stuff you need money alot of money we're talking about a million dollars here.You need money to stuff.The missions get a little repetive when you done them all.But luckily for you there's heists which were introduced in the Heists DLC where you need money to host them as you need a high end apartment to start one and one apartment like that costs 215000$. Making that kind of money at level 15 will take a while.But another thing ya need money to make money and that money you lose but that lost money makes you profit. Yeah its pretty weird.It's essentially a GTA MMO.But even from that I still enjoy it it still fun. Well I enjoy ALOT. More playtime is in the online mode then in the single player. It's not the single player is bad its great. Its just that I don't enjoy collecting stuff for too long so 100% this game will be pretty hard for me.EDIT I forgot there's 2 challenges that a new player can do to earn 250k each. Again if you really can't do money that well go on the GTA Online discord and go on #lfg pc and look for someone hosting Act 2 of Doomsday.But really you should think of the online as a bonus thing to do you should not buy the game for JUST the online the fun can be endless yes but thats depending on you. Spend your 30$ expecting a great single player with multi player as a side mode not as a thing your forced to do. Think of the online as a bonus game.But depending on your likes Online is fun as hell. about 450 hours of this game is online.TL DR Freaking awesome game online rough around the edges but its still awesome. Buy it for the single player not the online. Think of the online as a bonus game. Just buy it already its 30$ and 15$ on sale Single player 10/10Online 8.7/10,Grand Theft Auto V,5,514,6306,1201,5

5/25/2017,0,0,0,Not Recommended,"This game has a somewhat interesting concept that would normally align well with what I consider my favorite games in terms of genre style and so on. I really want to love this game but sadly I just can't bring myself to it. I get that this is early access and have fully considered that fact before leaving this review. That being said I also am not up to speed on the history and development of the game so some of my complaints about the game may be known and there for some compelling reason. The Good The world is pretty massive and has a fun layout with all the buildings and geography. The ARMA/DayZ mashup feel/concept is appealing to my gaming interests (in theory). It should be a good combo. There's gotta be something else??? The Bad Gameplay is fun for a bit. You get dropped onto an island and wander around killing other people as you run into them. It plays very much like DayZ (or similar) but what I actually think of more is the ""Gun Game"" mode from the later Call of Duty Black Ops game series. While you get to choose your weapons in PUBG it is still very much a game where you run around as fast as you can dodging bullets and eliminating other players like you would in Gun Game. All players in PUBG start on equal footing at the start of the match that is without any items or special perks. You must perform well (or get lucky) to get good weapons and increase your odds of survival. The concept is fun for a bit but gets repetitive very quickly. It felt like I was playing the same thing over and over again without any real variety. There was no development and nothing to keep me intrigued after a few rounds. I know that a lot of people like this repetitious style of gameplay but I don't love it and was bored to death before I knew it. I thought that maybe given how much world there was and all of the possible options for weapons and upgrades that it'd get old less quickly than other similar games. I wasted a lot of energy and gained a lot of frustration by getting disconnect in the matchmaking screen and occasionally in the middle of actual game play. I had so much trouble getting a good stable server connection that about half of my ""gameplay"" time recorded was actually me in the lobby trying to connect. I should mention that I have fiber optic internet and connections have never been an issue for me on any other game. I have not experiences framerate issues like others have had. I am running GTX 970's in SLI and was able to run the game in the ""Ultra"" graphics mode without issue. However the quality of the graphics still seemed pretty poor to me especially for Unreal Engine. I don't think it is just my incorrect perception the more I played the game the more I became sure that the graphics quality was more on par with UE 3 or something similar and outdated. My final complaint is with the match time and is potentially just my personal preference more than a hard fault of the game. At the beginning of the match you have several minutes to find weapons. At that point the region of gameplay starts shrinking and forces players to the center of the map. I get why this is necessary and I wouldn't want a 5 mile x 5 mile map with two players trying to find each other over the course of many hours. My complaint is that I feel like the amount of time between gameplay regions shrinking is too short. Gameplay and a singular match goes by too quickly. It'd be nice if they would double or triple the amount of time to slow down the game just a tad and allow players to focus more on scavenging and exploring. I really feel like this would increase the survival feel of the game which I thought was part of the point. Is exploration and scavenging generally part of the point of an MMO world too? It just felt as if there was too much focus on the fast paced shooter portion and not enough on the exploring and upgrading portion.In summary for the $30+ I paid I felt like I didn't get a very good value. There is nothing really unique about this game to make it worth that sort of money. It's a $15 game for sure. The MMO thing has been done many times before. The weapons are all very cookie cutter and there was nothing to really get excited about there. The graphics are lackluster. It gets boring really quickly and there are not really any qualities that I can think of that set this game apart.I rate the game 5/10 overall.

I see people downvoting the game because of hackers where as most of my time i'll meet a hacker and he won't be a and set people on fire (Although that did happen once) he was actually pretty cool and fun to play with and hackers haven't ruined my experience and i've had a great time playing.Also there is free dlc's which is probably the best part.Some company's should learn from this *cough* Payday 2 *cough*I'm having a great time it's worth the money story is great free dlc's. 9/10,Grand Theft Auto V,5,623,634,114,5

2/7/2014,0,0,24,Not Recommended,Be careful when the game says its a alpha and may change IT WILL. It recently just completly changed genre!!!! I simply cant recommend this game because there is no way to know what it will end up as. I bought this game excited that I have another zombie survival game but more chill then day z. What they did was take away zombies. They piggy backed the hype of day z by releasing a zombie game (which i think is reat its the whole reason i bought rust) only to take the money and then completly change the game. If you are interested in the game then WAIT UNTIL ITS 100% FULLY REALEASED or some or all of the parts you like about it may change. Yes every alpha is like this but ive never heard of one changing its biggest selling point AFTER seling 750 000 copies in a bit over a month.,Rust,1,24,788,155,1

I wish the createors would add a single player so you could avoid thoses situations. If you like survival games like the Day Z stand alone ( I recomend highly ) you would enjoy this game. You will hit bumps unless your friend owns a server and it is very fun with a group of friends. Over all its a good game great design concepts interesting multiplayer ( Very Interesting ) and great with friends if you dont know any one with this game and you cant get them to buy it it may be less of an enjoyable experince but with a few tweaks it can possible be the next minecraft.,Rust,3,6,732,145,3

The lag makes you feel like you have tourettes pls fix (secret tip it's the russians that makes the game lag with their high ping).9/11 very good game.No but seriously there is some problems that needs to be fixed like the performance and the lag but i am sure they will fix it so honestly i really think it's worth 30 bucks ).Edit I just don't understand why people are ing about microtransactions that are only cosmetics so why give a And i know playerunkown made a promise about not adding micro transcations until the game were finished but he also said that they are only going to test the system so learn to read and stop ing.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,431,886,164,5

This is exactly what we older gamers had hoped for and were afraid you might fall short of. It appears our fears were unfounded. Well Done. It is obvious that your team took great pains to stay true to the source material and bring it into the 21st century. RE2 Remake evokes the same fear and excitement as the original and it runs just beautifully! Thank you for all of the options to tweak graphical quality and game performance. Having these options means that I can easily recommend the game to people with all kinds of PCs knowing that they can fine tune their experience to an enjoyable point even if their computer isn't the newest/strongest/most expensive. This is a point that a lot of Triple A PC Game Developers forget about and I applaud you for it. If you remember playing the original 20 years ago you will not be disappointed in this version.If you never had the chance to experience Resident Evil 2 before I highly recommend you play this version. Though I did not pay $60 for my copy (I got the game for $45 pre release) I do agree that it's a fair price. The negatives I'm a little bit incensed that I have to buy DLC to hear the original announcer say ""RESIDENT EVIL.......TWOoooo"" on the splash screen. But in this day of rampant microtransactions designed to leech money from the consumer baked into nearly every new Triple A game I can let this one point slide. At some point I'll buy it just to experience that nostalgia But not today. Final verdict 10/10",RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,3,10,1616,296,3

8/18/2017,0,0,136,Not Recommended,"Earlier review left at bottom for reference my opinion since writing the original review has since changed. Previously I found that the game was a cool concept hamstrung by a few obnoxious flaws but worth the half AAA game price for the time that you would get out of it.Unfortunately for me and for this game I feel that the devs have added to these issues instead of fixing them.I made 3 points in my original review1) when you get shot it is extremely difficult to figure out where the shots came from before you die (this has not been tweaked but is only personal preference)2)the game needed a killer POV deathcam (this has been added YAY 1/3)3) Team play offeres very little in the way of rewards (this has been made EXPONENTIALLY worse with the advent of the greediest loot box scheme I have ever seen more below)so as you can see one of my problems went almost unaddressed the most minor of my complaints (one not affecting rewards or gameplay) was fixed and the rewards system was gutted into the ground by the 1.0 patch.TO CLARIFYthe greedy loot box practice i am talking about is not the practice of the loot boxes themselves but the fact that loot boxes are now ONLY avalible through payment. the old system had loot boxes with (admittedly crappier) gear avalible to STICKER PRICE players which allowed them some level of customizability. Now the ONLY way to get loot boxes is to earn them in game THEN shell out $2.50 each for keys to open them no free option no nothing.In addition this game's cheating has gotten out of control. especially because region locking would simply fix the problem. At this point the cheaters are making enough money opening loot boxes that the expense of their accounts being banned can be easily written off as the cost of doing business we need better anti cheat on top of that they only allow players to report for snap aiming move speed hacks and other aimbots there is no option for HP hacking or other exploits.for these reasons my solid reccomendation is turned to a no go bring back free lootboxes and make the cheaters lives at least a bit harder and I will address this review again. Old review for the record I cant say much about this that everybody else has not the game is amazing with a couple caviats. it SERIOUSLY needs better indicators of where you have been shot from at least in single player. I would suggest a classic ""blood splatter points in the direction you are shot from"" system to accompany shot noises with things like flash hiders and suppressors making the indicator less clear.I would love to see a kill cam from the POV of the person who killed you at least in solos.Better rewards in team mode would also be great.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,136,2692,484,1

Outside of doing dumb stuff I never really enjoyed the sports games because the mechanics just felt clunky and not inherently fun especially as I never enjoyed sports IRL. Rocket League though... It's like the sports game for people who don't like sports games or even IRL sports. My brothers and I now in our 20's don't even care about winning. The game itself is just so dang fun to play and it's the perfect example of a game that's easy to learn and hard to master. And learning to master the game (i.e flying through the air to score sick goals and manage epic saves) is INCREDIBLY fun but its absolutely not necessary to enjoy the game. Want casual play?** play unranked and turn off chat check out some of the arcade y game modes (like ""hoops"" a basketball esque twist) Want that good ol' LAN party feel? grab some controllers and play splitscreen and/or invite friends to play online Love the thrill of domination? climb the ranked ladder and bust your butt in the official training modes and community made Workshop trainers E sports? Find Rocket League on Twitch and realize just how unimaginably insane the game gets at the highest skill levels Love collecting items? Or spending hours designing your character with unlocked loot? you can win one or more cosmetics at the end of nearly every game win or lose ranked or unranked! Unlock special cosmetics for climbing the ranked ladder! Browse a variety of free out of the box cars paint textures and various ornaments! Also lootboxes DLC and more!**I should note that apparently a lot of other people playing the game get really salty tilted and toxic. Are they the majority?

Blue zone/killing circle moves too fast2. You can stay on the outside see in and shoot into the circle from the blue zone/killing circle until the very last circles3. The timing of the circle is variable by how many have died so there is no planning or timing possibilities. You can get ed just because 20 guys died in various gun fights4. Cheaters 5. Vehicles got nerfed. They are now slower than they used to be. Even your grandmothers Corolla can do more than 120 if you step on it6. Diving/swimming got nerfed to br&gt 7. Nades was funny/functional in that it moved the person being hit.. that is gone8. Nades do crazy damage now9. Nades can not flip a car/boat anymore. Due to the damage buff it simply explodes10. The circle does not move slower on the bigger map (miramar) which is obviously what it should do. You go on a big map to play longer.. it is not rocket science.11. They nerfed the silencer on the VSS. It is now like a normal ump/pistol in sound level 12. Helmets does not work. Everyone kills (cheaters?) in a single headshot it seems. Not just the sniper rifles which is ok13. No map selection anymore14. No fog or rain at all. Even as an map option/allowed situation15. They nerfed loot on Erangel. And they chanced parts of the map so it became more uniform/bland.16. Loot is everywhere on the Saigon map17.

Even if by some chance you get it to work for you and you encounter someone expect hit detection issues. You spend 10 minutes gathering gear and traveling only to encounter bad hit detection once you come across someone. Game over. If you have never actually played a good game before then sure this game might be ok for you. The standards are clearly set very low for those that praise the game. Don't buy the hype. The developers will be the same as the other games that promise improvements but never deliver. AND as of right now 3 months since it's early access release it is still as buggy as it was since release. Save your money until they bother to work out the infinite amount of bugs.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,3,1011,188,1

12/13/2018,0,0,97,Recommended,I believe that I've played enough to leave a review. The story is nice I've played it for a good 20 hours or so. But I'm not the type of person that does the story in a game I'm focused more on the online aspect of this game.The online mode is fun there are tons of challenges to do and missions you can do with other players. I've came across a few negative players but about half I've came across are pretty nice. For some reason people like to kill you randomly probably because they're bored which is annoying. I recommend playing online if you have friends to help you. If you would like to play sometime just go ahead and send me a friend request always looking for people to play with.Online (solo) 7/10Online (friends) 8.5/10,Grand Theft Auto V,3,97,733,137,3

9/9/2018,0,0,412,Recommended,Been playing the Monster Hunter Series since its debut on the PS2 this is a good addition to the series if you are new to it and want a different take on it. It can be easier in comparison to some of the other titles however it has its own little spark and its own little nuances that still make it very enjoyable to play. Personally i could do without some features but that is an old hunter talking all in all i am just really happy that water levels do not exist those where terrible and i hope they never come back to the series again...ˢᶜᵒᵘᵗᶠˡᶦᵉˢ ˢᵘᶜᵏ ᵗᵒᵒ ᵇᵘᵗ ᵗʰᵃᵗˢ ʲᵘˢᵗ ᵐᵉ...,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,412,581,113,5

6/17/2017,1,1,284,Not Recommended,"fun game lots of content in both singleplayer and multiplayer. Everything's alright in terms of gameplay and the PC version does offer very good looking graphical additions that the consoles do not. Even after having all this said I would've wanted to recommend the game but now I've changed my mind. The game isn't worth getting due to the turn they've taken with the online mode. It's practically just pay2win or grind for 100's of hours to get what you want. The singleplayer is not worth 60 usd alone since they've also refused to release SP DLC and instead focus on hoarding in money through ""free"" online updates that bring new cars/properties for millions of in game cash which you can buy for real money or grind a good 10 hours for one item. Also want to point out the fact that there are many ""hackers/modders"" in the online section giving players free money that they get banned for not the modder unless he's reported. So you're taking a risk by playing online you could be banned although innocent..Do not get this game unless you really want the Singleplayer experience.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,284,1084,190,1

But first some backstory Rust caught my eye when UberHaxorNova played it when it was still just in legacy it automatically caught my eye. They updated it moved clients added new things.Since you and I dont have all day ill make this quick.This game is NOT friendly. No matter what you do or what you say people will always shoot on sight so you MUST do the same. But maybe you save a naked and they give you a gun TOO BAD They will kill you later.That doesnt mean Rust is a bad game it means you are rewarded for being the bad guy and as Wreck it Ralph says ""I'm Bad and that's good I will never be good and that's not bad there's no one Id rather be...than me.""This game will toss you around and make you cry but theres always this feeling that brings you back...

10/29/2016,1,44,0,Not Recommended,None of the old mods are working. Currently there are 20 mods added and they can only be accessed via Bethesda account. Once most of the mods from Nexus is available to be added freely it might worth buying if you have not seen it before currently if any Nexus mod is installed it is not even start the game for me. Since this is nothing more then Bethesda trying to take multiple skins from the same fox a simple money grab I suggest either to buy the legendary edition or wait till this one will have proper mod support. Also unsure why anyone is drooling over it since the graphics is old ugly without mods it is simply too foggy blurry.

12/15/2015,0,0,182,Recommended,This game... WOW!Ive put 400 hundred hours onto this game on Console but when i transferred to PC i have put around 125 hours as of this review. My world changed for this game. The graphics much deeply improved with mods everywhere including enhancers and texture packs.Although RP isnt much enforced into this game i love doing it with my friends as i see it as a huge part of the game in my opininon. This is because youve got a Huge city with lots of activities and i believe that RP should be included such as having to eat or real life activities such as Fishing or playing basketball. As of this review a casino update is being speculated which i assure my self and many others are looking forward to. I hope this brings in an option allowing you to gamble and play casino games with and against friends!Recently with the New update (The executives and criminals) the features of this DLC are many things that have been daunting my mind and they are now reality. Huge fricking yachts that are just badass in every aspect and my new favourite The Organization. This allows you and your friends to be in a official team that brings a variety of perks as well as a nice even variety of missions and game modes including my favourite Yacht piracy. Heists Always struggling to find that 4th person.. Weve been there. This update was delayed time and time again until it was finally released earlier this year. It brought a HUGE variety of things to the table New guns vehicles clothing equipment and of all The heists them selves. These missions give the oppurtunity of you and your friends teaming up in a group of four and completing a series set up missions for the big finale. Despite some set ups being a pain i can assure the pay outs are very rewarding.This game was released 2 years ago and it is still very popular and well played BUT there have been periods at time where the playerbase has just died.I highly recommend this game as it has SO much to do with a brilliant story hundreds of features and an epic online mode.Sadly im going to end this review on a bad note...Unfortunately hackers and modders are ruining the Online mode of the gane which destroys the thriving players and community of this game.,Grand Theft Auto V,4,182,2220,404,4

8/29/2018,0,0,12,Recommended,This is a fun lighthearted game. I am not a big FPS fan as I used to do it in real life. I find such games have a place I find them to be a good stress ball but when played often they have the reverse effect. This game is about mining exploring and building. I love the atmosphere of the game as the stars moons or other planets cross the sky and you can fly to them. The mining is much more as the ground reacts in a fluid clay like motion not big square blocks. I would love to see more building brought into the game. I actually was attracted to this game after playing Terra Tech for like 2 days straight. Astroneer has more modular building aspect to it. You build a platform that has slots where equipment plugs into such as seats or power sources that are crafted at a machine or smaller components straight from your backpack. Equipment can also be salvaged as you explore planets. I wish it would introduce a building aspect somewhat like Terra Tech so you could get more creative in your mining and space endevours. I give it a 3.7 out of 5 in its current state. Fun game with great potential.,ASTRONEER,3,12,1103,212,3

It's becoming filled with loot boxes and they just keep adding to it every month as if it's a free to play game. They ruined the recoil of the AR weapons which in turn lowered the skill ceiling with regards to shooting and as their player numbers have dropped two thirds they've decided to put it on sale and release a paid ""event pass"" which is similar to the fortnite model except Fortnite is free and this is almost 30. So not only do they charge your for the game they also charge to unlock cosmetics and have an ""event pass"" which is essentially a subscription based model for unlocking cosmetic items within the game.

3/21/2018,0,0,117,Not Recommended,"This game is polished (for the most part) and if you're merely looking for a ""battle royale"" this a great game for you. I've had conflicting oppinions of this game the gameplay itself is fun but not satisfying enough. Personally I'm not too much of a fan of battle royale and the devs are not exactly what I call great. They kind of killed the mood for me over development. For instance when their servers were over loaded with people hacking and exploting the game. The initial response from the devs was that the issue was already taken care of when it wasn't and they proceeded to tell their customers that they were wrong instead of listening and take care of the issue professionally. Now that's just a bit of a nit pick. The real issue from the devs and the company itself was how they were viewing the exclusivity of ""their"" genre. They proceeded to push law suits against epic games for copying their game which is entirely t but they did it anyways. The irony is that a couple months later they integrate the same type of battle pass fortnite has now if that's not hypocrisy I don't know what is.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,117,1105,203,1

6/11/2017,1,1,18,Not Recommended,It takes too long to get a basic understanding of how things in this game work. If you go in blind then it takes more than 2 hours (the steam refund time limit) to understand what actions have what consequences relative to other players and the killer. Once you begin to understand then it becomes boring because every match is the exact same. None of the maps are good only less bad compared to the others. I've played bill for 15 16 of my 17 hours played and i'm only level 15 and it takes rather high levels to get interesting or valuable perks.In short boring maps suck and any variety in survivors comes after many hours.,Dead by Daylight,1,18,626,117,1

2/9/2014,0,0,1221,Recommended,Rust is probably one of the best games you will ever play with friends granted that you know what you're doing and you have the time to commit to it. That's the review in short. Continuing on Rust requires lots of dedication both physically and mentally to obtain most of its worth with the game having a relatively steep learning curve and high skill ceiling which you can reach to after playing for a while in and with the deadly environments and blood thirsty dangers both automated and player controlled the game will provide you with. There will be times where the game absolutely pisses you off and times where you'll love it to bits. Playing the game for two hours and then quitting is simply not enough to decide your thoughts about this game.To play Rust you will need time. Lots and lots of time. Rust is probably best played when you're on some sort of break or holiday from your job college or school or any responsiblities you have as Rust just needs so much time though this is mostly the case if you're playing alone as a solo you will almost always benefit from playing Rust with friends. Tell your friends to get Rust. Tell your friends of friends to get Rust. Tell your friends' families to get Rust. Once you have all join a server and start bashing rocks and build a massive ing base. The higher your numbers the higher chance you have of survival and the faster progression of tools weaponry and state of living you will experience. Attempting to play the game solo is basically hardcore mode and I wouldn't recommend it unless you enjoy dying lots falling behind in progression compared to others and being reared by Rust's community. This leads the review onto Rust's community. As you've probably gathered from other reviews they're we get it. They kill on sight murder new spawns as a sport and then think they have the right to flame in voice chat afterwards with you knowing the fact that behind that screen they're simply either some pre teen that long stroke sprinted home from school sweat covered to play with their ten man zerg or some young adult that recently gathered their only ounce of confidence from insulting others in Rust. Absolute tards however there are gems within the said community. Sometimes you'll run into a few friendly people who'll want to talk help you out or even join you on your survival adventure. But most of the times people will try to kill you as the thought of looting your lifeless corpse for your long worked for gear is greater than the incentive to be a good guy. To combat this you can simply join their ranks. Kill everyone you see take no prisoners show no remorse become a bandit. Though don't be a about it be respectful.Once you know what you're doing in the harsh world of Rust you'll find that gun fights are amazingly adrenaline packed building bases from all the resources you gathered is satisfying and simply roaming and looting is both fun and adventerous. It will probably get you addicted.Rust unfortunately has many many negative reviews that I feel to some part are unjustified as people just apparently don't want to dig for a resolution and would instead slander the very hard working devs whom of which update the game with content and fixes monthly and care about the game oh so very much. You'll find that most of the reviews complain about server loading times how hard it is to play optimisation the time you need to dedicate and the community. Let this review set these things straight In terms of server loading times there is an easy solution. Browse for other servers. It sounds dumb but it's that simple. It would seem that people especially new players try to join official servers because they're official. Don't bother. They're typically the ones that have full server slots and are filled to the brim with players that are toxic. Official servers are not user friendly and are definitely a no go for new players. Even I have never joined an official server before. I would recommend looking at community servers within the community tab in the browser if you're looking for the vanilla Rust experience. This leads onto How hard the game is to play. It is indeed a very hard game to play but there are a few options that you can choose to help you get into the game. You could begin by joining a low population or empty community server to get into grips with the mechanics of this game without the nuisance of players trying to kill you. You could also join a 'creative' server which gives you unlimited resources and can be found in the modded servers tab in the browser to work on your base building skills. The Rust wiki and watching videos also helps. The optimisation sucks in this game but turning down your graphics can actually be advantageous to your survival as there will be less clutter and noise on your screen so it's easier to spot things out. However the point of this part is to tell you about the fullscreen launch command. Rust doesn't actually run in fullscreen but instead fullscreen borderless because backend reasons. You can however force Rust to run into fullscreen mode to boost your FPS and reduce input lag. This can be done by right clicking Rust in your Steam library and pressing 'properties' pressing 'set launch options' and copying &amp pasting ' window mode exclusive' into the prompt. WIth this command Rust is forced into fullscreen mode. Beware of alt + tabbing out of Rust though there is a chance it can crash because of something something Unity engine and your desktop will probably freeze. You can try and reach the task manager to kill the Rust process but once again it'll be pretty hard to do with a frozen desktop. Just don't alt tab out and you'll be fine Rust definitely requires lots of time to get the most out of it. If you don't have loads of time to play Rust you can choose to play on modded servers which can be found in the modded tab in the browser. From there you can find servers with increased gather rates along side other things. An upped gather rate essentially increases how many resources you would obtain normally by using a multiplier. This means that you will progress significantly faster and overall do stuff in the game sooner than you would in the vanilla game. You can't really change the community of this game but you can definitely dampen the toxicity of it. By choosing the right server with the right people the dickish force the community usually throws at you can be reduced.Once everything clicks for you in Rust it'll quickly become one of your favourite games ever.P.S. No Rust will not run on your Intel Pentium and for all the people with NASA computers complaining that Rust runs at 30 FPS at lowest settings you many wanna you know get your machine checked out.,Rust,5,1221,6749,1202,5

8/21/2018,0,0,213,Not Recommended,I love the monster hunter series Ive been playing the series for 8+ years and the game its self is great but this port to PC is an insult. First off the mouse imput is terrible theres no direct input it just emulates the joystick. secondly the keyboard interactions with things such as menues and NPCs is garbage you have to do finger gymnastics to get through them. I honestly dont know what the beta phase even was because there are so many glaring issues I cant possibly imagine they thought everything was working perfectly and couldnt be improved.Theres also the matter with save file corruption after fighting xeno'jiiva or just down right disappearing save files.Neither of these are exclusive to PC either but they have gotten a lot more attention now that a section of the community that has been waiting for years has had to deal with them.Im not even going to go in to the lack of optimization. Warframe witcher 3 remember me tomb raider and numerous other games are all vastly more graphically intensive and still run with no problems on mid range computers. My computer is well above mid range and the game still runs like i have a GTX450.EDIT Ive been informed that save corruption is a result of windows missing codecs. I appreciate this but that is not the fault of the end user nor the fault of windows. It is up to the developer to have the game shipped with all software required to play it or to at least tell you you need to install specific software to run optimally.EDIT 2 Removed complaints about network issues as a fix has been put out see patch notes.Ill change my review to positive when things are fixed.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,213,1633,294,1

10/26/2017,0,0,144,Not Recommended,Welcome to PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS! Or as I like to call it Loot and Die Simulator 2017! Seriously that's all you will do in this game. You spend 20 minutes looting the crap out of buildings MAYBE you encounter one or two enemies who you are able to overcome but as soon as the circle closes in you realise that you will not be surviving. This may not be because of your skill maybe you have played shooters before. No you won't survive because this game is OPTIMIZATION HELL.You want 60 fps? Too bad even when you set everything on lowest quality you still only get 40 50 except for when you use a 1080/1080ti and a new ryzen or i7 or whatever. Then you can MAYBE play the game on higher settings maybe even highest. Too bad that you will still have frame drops everytime you shoot and 9 out of 10 battles are decided by who had less technical problems. But that's all okay isn't it? PLAYERUNKOWN and Bluehole are working on the game right? YES! THEY ARE! So don't worry. The game will become better with new updates which are released weekly. WRONG! They apparently don't have motivation to work on important parts of the game anymore with all the money they now have. But here is something for you Loot Crates! Everyone loves Loot Crates right? Especially if you have to pay to open them and get that sweet sweet gamble. Will I get a 20 dollar jacket or a 10 cent hat? I don't know! What a fun experience!And when they are adding a patch that has nothing to do with loot crates? Yeah they implement the most important stuff. Your game runs on 30 fps because you can't afford a new 2000 dollar PC? No problem we got you fam! Here have this new vault animation! That's not enough? Okay here have this new foggy weather! We do stuff for the players!Don't buy this s h i t t y game before they try to fix anything optimization wise. Luckily I got my 30 dollars back through the crates I opened (hey just because I'm blaming them for implementing something like that doesn't mean I won't use it) and now this game will sit in my library until the game is a) improved quite a bit or b) I become desperate in what I want to play.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,144,2131,402,1

Having a mic will really help you progress further with other players. Make sure you have people to play with. It's fun alone but even better with a group of people. Give the game time to load.

6/29/2017,1,3,140,Not Recommended,If you plan on buying this game remeber everything rockstar does is to make money. They don't care about reputation or about user enjoyment. Meaning every new release every car every in game purchase is designed to cost in game money which they then sell you. Starting this game is practically impossible the best ways to make money start at over a million each and good luck getting that winnning a race grants you a grand or two same with robbing stores. Oh but what about heists? That requires 3 other friends randoms don't help or join you there is never enough people to try your luck at starting heists with the hope random people will join you. Also a complete heist only grants you about 60k so you gotta really work for that money. Maybe you'll just buy a cheap car and not go for the exspensive money making endevors. Well too ing bad. Cheap cars that actually work start at 150k 250k. Plus if you want to change anything about them be prepared to shell out 50k+. This all comes back to shark cards besides cheaters the only resonable way to make money in the game something thats required to enjoy the game.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,140,1118,205,1

It's fun for a bit because you're initially scared of the killers and what they can do and have fun surviving with your friends. Using teamwork to try to outsmart the killer is a good concept but this game just squanders any chance of fun that the survivors try to get. The hooks that the killer uses to hang survivors they've caught are FAR too frequent making the ""wiggle"" function completely useless. The killers are frequently faster than survivors making it impossible to outrun or get away from them when they spot you. Also the fact that all of the DLC is far too expensive when it shouldn't even cost anything to begin with. The developers are clearly not using any funds from these stupidly priced DLCs to better their game because it is just horrendous nearly 3 years after release. I can't fathom how anyone would spend money on this game and I'm only glad that I played it during free weekends so that I don't have to regret doing so.

Build a shelter. Kill animals for meat. Protect yourself from other players.""That selling is only correct in the last sentence.I assumed that there was a more compelling ""man vs. nature"" element to the game scarce food scarce clothing scarce shelter and that it would drive player interactions. Sure I may team up with someone and make a shelter together. Or it could be that only one of us can live with what we've got. In which case one of us may have to kill the other. We may team up and defend ourselves. Or we may turn on each other or hunt players as the best means to survive against the elements.In reality there's an over abundance of resources. The materials to make food clothing and shelter are everywhere. One doesn't have to kill anyone to survive against nature. Ever.Which brings out the actual gameplay one has to kill other players because they will kill you and take your stuff. For fun.This isn't a man vs. nature survival game. It's a PVP/looting/raiding game. Which for some reason wants to start you out with a rock and no pants.Still it's fun in it's own way.

They made their own company suing Fortnite for copyright etc. etc. but they should fix so many other issues. Servers have gotten worse by the hour. Streamers and raging and reporting players who kill them in humiliating way and overall the game has gone to the pits.

4/14/2017,0,0,514,Recommended,"I have been burnt on so many early access games as you may all have too. My deciding factor on buying this game was that I felt I could trust my friends who say AS IS that the game is great. While other games have promised features updates and plans of improvement PUBG has an already fun easy to learn and hop right into game. I feel that the game has already paid for itself in the 7.6 hours I have played with only taking a break to get food. I do not feel immediately burnt I do not feel as if it is a game that ""just needs a couple of months to get it worked out and then we can have fun and play as a group"" and most of all I feel like it has a SOLID starting point as in that we don't have to wait to have fun. The fun is here it will just improve over time. My first few games were with a couple buddies the mechanics were easy to jump right into from playing Arma and such. In those first couple of games I was just getting the hang of it and eventually made it to a #3 spot in the game. That was great I was immersed heart racing yelling with my buddy to push out and shoot people and 100% into the game. By the end of the night I was ready to keep playing. Pros Great Game Not just a base of a game with empty promisesYou can just jump right in and start playingIt has a great map and navigation systemHas a good selection of gunsQuick to get into a game quick to get out and start another.Combat seems to be inbetween Arma and Rainbow Six Siege a good balance.It has realism but not so much that you lose fun just to be more realistic.The vehicles drive well not too arcade esque. Inventory system and attachments are very easy to use.Map is easy to use on the run along with quickly using inventory.The game is quite beautiful IMO with not too much flare that makes you turn down settings to see another player.Lots of little things that you won't notice because they are done right and that's a good thing.Cons Performance is the main one rain needs to be optimized HEAVILY. Opening doors and entering vehicles needs to have a bit of tweaking with the delays.The fact that I didn't buy this game earlier.Network lag is an issue sometimes.In the beforegame lobby when people are shooting rapidly it causes a lot of lag.Parachuting should be a little bit quicker when landing.Footsteps should be a slight bit more pronouncedI'm really nit picking because there aren't a ton of things wrong here but maybe more cars?And also lastly a larger distinction between driveable and non driveable cars.Suggestions Add armor for cars and attachments? More scope varietiesVariety of guns addedInstead of a single plane dropping maybe twoMore carsA player positioning system similar to ARMA 3 where CTRL+W/S Makes you go in (12 positions?) from prone to standing?Obviously more clothing options (I'm sure they are in the works)And lastly add boats I think that would be a very interesting thing to spice things up.All in all I was scared and vowed to never buy another ""Early access"" title (AKA Give me you money now so we don't have to finish the game). I made an exception when I saw PUBG and I am very glad that I did! Would recommend 8/10 and I am sure that it will soon reach a 10/10 for me.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,514,3196,602,5

I had already decided to never buy one of their games again over a year ago when they actively sought out and banned moderators on modding forums from GTA Online...moderators who had not even developed mods nor used mods in multiplayer.

8/23/2018,2,2,62,Not Recommended,"A weeaboo version of Dark souls with worse hit boxes 5 small maps and a dozen of recolored dragons.The only thing to do in the game is to bash the same monsters on the same maps for hours to get materials to craft equipment to be able to hunt the same monsters but with slightly more HP so the fights are even longer.Please note that high rank equipment have the same appearance than low rank armor so there's basically no point to ever play this game.Multiplayer Broken can't connect 50% of the time leaderboards are full of cheaters so basically broken don't assume that this game is better with friends or in coop it's even worse because multiplayer makes the game stupidly easy.Audio Music is voice acting is even worse than musicGraphics Overall OK except the game has a bug where it will display 30% of the textures with lowest resolutions textures LOD making it strange. Way too much motion blur. The green trails they put to show you the path ruin everything and they are confusing as hell to follow anyway.Story Stupid as noone caresGameplay Basically dodge monsters for 2 minutes then do your combo when it's tired(press 4 buttons each weapon has only 1 combo) repeat for 30 minutes.Price This is downright scam the amount of content in this game is what you'd expect from a 9.99 DLCAlso they sell you stickers and emotes for real check it out.Bottom line It took me a few hours to realize this game is worthless everyone told to play the story until I reach high rank then it will be ""much better"" well truth is this is still and I can't get refunded.I've not mentionned technical issues because my computer is crazy good and can somewhat run this at 4K 60fps but there are many reports of it running like because of crazy cpu usage and denuvo isn't helping.I deeply regret paying money for this",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,62,1806,324,1
8/22/2018,0,0,268,Recommended,MH W is nowhere perfect but it's more than playable.I understand that everyone expects multiplayer to work properly but if you were to make a list of online multiplayer games launched in the last decade that didn't have server issues on launch you're going to get very tired of making that list. Server issues are expected and anyone who says otherwise is lying to themselves.Will the server issues be fixed? Yes I have every confidence that they will. Because although Capcom isn't a particularly awesome company every single one of the Monster Hunter games in the past has had wonderful support from it's developers way longer than expected for games nowadays. There is no doubt that they are working on the multiplayer issues so that is something that will not be a problem in the future.Besides the server issues some people have had technical issues as well. I have a mid range PC and I can run this perfectly fine so I'm not going to comment on the technical issues. However things like the mouse being draggy have also been acknowledged by the developers who are urgently working on the server fix but have promised to look into this as well.The game is wonderful for an introduction to the world of Monster Hunter. It's much less complicated and more convenient than a usual Monster Hunter game while still keeping the thrill of the hunt alive.If in a month or so the servers are still not fixed then yes I would be disappointed and not recommend the game. But as of now as I am confident the problems will be fixed I absolutely recommend this blast of a game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,268,1568,278,5

It REALLY ERALLY is. But the games servers aren't very stable. At all. nor is thier matchmaking system. Since this is basically at its core a multiplayer game these two issue force me to give a negative review.For example. You load into a ranked 2 player game but because the servers are unstable someone is often left without a teammate and in ranked you aren't given an AI replacement.At least 40% (more likely more) of thier servers lag horribly causing you to miss your targets. While mildly amusing these games are extremely frustrating.That games lots of fun when you have close competitive games but its also really irritating when you have these games interupted with complete trash laggy servers or poor matchmaking.,Rocket League®,1,260,899,156,1

But this really turned me off for the game together with spending so much time gathering basic materials and dying and gathering and dying. I never got to even try buidling a base because the moment I start gathering stuff I die. Can't recommend this game unless you have friends who are good at the game already. Not for new players especially if you are alone.",Rust,1,4,948,178,1

Normally I don't have a problem with capitalism but Rockstar focused all of their efforts on the Shark card system the campaign itself was designed so they'd have an excuse for heists in multiplayer so they can push Shark cards. The campaign story is the worst out of all of the games and I wonder why.However it is one of the most optimized games I think I've ever played.

5/7/2018,0,0,1125,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a flawed gem of a game. Of all the games that have attempted an asymmetrical multiplayer horror survival game Dead by Daylight has by far been the most successful. Pitting a killer against 4 unarmed survivors the game is essentially a slasher film in game form. After a few hours most players will have become numb to the theme revealing the true nature of the game cat and mouse.Now this isn't a bad thing. Cat and mouse is a tried and true formula that few digital games have attempted. In this metric the game is legitimately good although also deeply flawed. The issue arises from the game from when players understand the game well enough to take advantage of level geometry. Rather than trying to hide from the cat the most efficient strategies involve running around certain objects taking advantage of the faster turning radius of the survivor versus killer in order to vastly extend chase time. Combined with a variety of killers that simply ignore stealth the game simply emphasizes chases far more than hiding to the point that high level play gets very samey.Nonetheless the game is still fairly enjoyable given that its primary competitors are far less engaging.,Dead by Daylight,5,1125,1195,205,5

The fact that i've spent almost 3 of the the past 5 days immersed in it's world tells anyone how addictive and rewarding this game is. In the world of Rust you can't trust anybody! Where resources as basic and simple as wood and stone become valued commodities you will feel emotions such as ""fear"" and ""loss"" when your perfect shack is destroyed and everythign you have is taken. This game has an enormous capacity to make the player genuinely feel threatened scared frusterated and humbled. Please make a note that this game takes time to master and you will be frusterated that the guy with everything takes your life for the little raw chicken you possess but it's moments like these you learn valuable lessons in survival.Trust nobody Keep everything safe gather all you and if you find yourself in harms way..RUN!!Play Rust people..

4/1/2018,0,0,26,Not Recommended,"Bought this game a few days ago despite the horible reviews. I should have listened to them. Just in the matter of the 9 hours I've spent playing this game I have come past these bugs 1) When making my nickname it did not allow me to delete any characters once I typed them. So to fix that I had to close out the program and reopen it when the username I chose was taken. (Before I even got to play the game I found a bug)2) My second or third game playing I was on a motorcycle and it would not let me get off of it. I recieved an error code something like ""You can not exit vehicle"". So there went a good 15 minute game wasted. I had to close the program and start a new game.3) When I select ""Start"" to begin a game it will freeze ""Starting Match""4) After I die It does not let me watch my death cam because the server is ""too busy"". Apparently the server has been too busy for two day straight. (Yes I have death cam enabled). I beleive this game has the potential to be great but considering it has been out for over a year now and has more bugs than most betas that I've played... PUBG will not reach its full potential. This says a lot about the development team BlueWaffle I mean BlueHole has chosen to employ.

2/4/2015,0,0,2776,Recommended,Oh Rust how you have changed.You know how certain things are special unique to their own? Nobody sounds like Marilyn Manson nothing tastes like coffee nothing smells like pesto nothing feels like burning yourself and nothing looks like somebody getting kicked in the balls except for what it is.Now there's rust there is no other experience that will make you hate both yourself and everybody around you quite like Rust.Enjoy wasting thousands of hours for no apparent outcome? Enjoy really getting into the niddy griddy of human nature and mankind as a whole? Do you enjoy lying to people for personal gain or the possibility of befriending somebody in need just so that they can murder you and take everything you have?Well Rust is the game for you if you said yes to some or all of the above.Now on a personal note I've found a lot out about myself in Rust ...both sarcastically and legitimately. I am not a solo player at least in this game called Rust. I do much better in groups.Note if you don't like fighting groups or being part of them do not venture into this magical game.I am however great at uniting forces and making it even more difficult for other people to want to play. There was once 3 super powers on a server I won't name .. clans who ruled them all. I had made friends with people from within all 3 clans and helped create a merger that lasted a few wipes.It was chaos sweet beautiful chaos. Bases were created that were impregnable and rockets were made in abundance that were instead used as bullets.BittersweetI have also played with many other races/ ethnicity and on a genuine note I am really appreciative to the creators of Rust for this. I have picked up a bit of basic Korean due to time spent with zergs speaking of zergs the Chinese I've played with are hilarious and fun to play with. Russians yes they are just like in the movies crazy.. But also some of the most loyal to play with. Portuguese these guys have huge hearts and instantly befriend anybody nice to them great guys. Phillipinos are fairly timid until enraged then fly off the handle like you would imagine a shark with legs on land... Canadians are as nice as you think but have some weird subconscious military tendencies that both impress and alarm you why you never saw it.

12/3/2017,0,0,1256,Not Recommended,You know it sucks buying broken games. SO BUYERS BEWARE!!!Game is broken on the servers ran by facepunch. They don't admin or have active GMs on them. (servers ran by people normally have active admins to ban people) Therefore people are abusing the clinet in many ways. HACKS is the biggest example. Other huge problem is the severs can be forced to crash. (this is an OLD SCHOOL CONNECTION GLITCH) I joined a sever not knowing it was active with cheaters. A group of friends and I were raiding the biggest teams base on the server while they were offline. No sight of them at all. All of a sudden the server goes do due to too many people trying to log into the server. (its a 200 man server and only around 60 people were on) So the server goes down. takes an hour or so to reset. (ONCE BACK IN I WAS THE FIRST ONTO THE SERVER) I'm back in the enemy base (alone while my sleeping mates try to log back in) All of a sudden here comes the MAIN cheater running in guns blazing (within 30 secons of server being back up) HE HAD NO IDEA WE WERE IN THERE.... GHOSTED THE SERVER CRASHING IT THEN COUNTERING OUR RAID WHILE EVERYONE LOGS BACK IN!? (THIS IS AN OLD SCHOOL CONNECTION GLITCH THAT CHEATHERS HAVE BEEN USING FOR YEARS!) It is nearly impossible to prove who did in beyound being in the middle of the action. (due to online proxys the company cant ban the IP or USER doing it since it's not there real IP) THE RUST COMMUNITY HAS A NAME FOR THE GHOSTING GLITCH! They all it DDOSing.... (so the biggest team on this server has gotten that way by cheating Crashing the server everytime they are about to lose something huge) ALSO REPORTING THE CHEATERS SEEMS TO BE A WASTE OF TIME!!! There are KNOWN cheaters on most servers.... Why doesnt this company deal with cheaters? Not sure. but IT MAKES AN EXTREMELY WELL BUILT AND FUN GAME..... HORRIBLE!!!!!!!,Rust,1,1256,1854,345,1

Better with friends / release a SOS flare and playing with randoms. Just better in general not playing solo as that gets a bit boring.Best part?

10/22/2017,0,0,93,Not Recommended,Stale gameplay and horrible matchmaking.The only real difference I've noticed between survivors is how visible they are to the killer while hiding. With killer the only real differnce is the special ability which will nice doesn't greatly impact gameplay.The matchmaking of this game is horrible. It'll put brand new players with the lowest possible rank up against full teams of rank 15+ or up against random spreads of a few low ranks and then one increadibly high rank player. I've seen games with a rank 19 killer two rank 19 survivors 1 rank 14 and 1 rank 8.Not only is the matchmaking toxic but the community as a whole can be as well. You'll get teams of 3 or 4 who will refuse to actually work towards the survivors goal until they've farmed everything AND everyone on the team is healthy. Who will body block you and taunt you when try to do anything and equip themselves with the BEST flashlights possible and then the second you try to do ANYTHING will take the first possible opportunity to shine said flashlight in your face. And then mock you in chat for not being able to do anything.TL DR If you like toxic communities or have friends to play this with go for it. Otherwise skip it.,Dead by Daylight,1,93,1198,216,1

8/16/2018,0,0,53,Recommended,Disclaimer I am a die hard monster hunter fan since the original on PS2. I've played every monster hunter ranging from the original on PS2 to the wii and 3ds games. Monster hunter world is the next step in revolutionizing the series and it does a good job of it. The game is addicting more so then ever and its truely a beautiful experince that takes something thats usually tedious like grinding and makes it enjoyable. Although the PC port of the game is Meh This is suppose to be Capcom's first attempt at making a pc port and it really shows there's so many missing basic features that PC players are used to. Also there's huge server issues still even a week after launch this same thing happened with the Xbox One and Playstation 4 version of Monster hunter World. All in all despite its issues i highly reccommend Monster Hunter World to fans and new comers a like. You need to experince this game you will well get your moneys worth here.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,53,946,174,3

3/21/2018,0,0,821,Recommended,What is there left to say that hasn't been said about Rocket League yet?Rocket League initially has gotten a lot of attention due to Psyonix letting streamers promote it. The game became popular the streamers stopped playing it but the players stayed. And this is where the game has to survive on its own legs and it actually does which is why it maintains a high playerbase.I am a big fan of the racing genre I love nothing more than a proper challenge a game delivering me challenging but yet fair physics paired with the proper environment to use these physics is what makes a great Racing game for me.Rocket League has done an absolute perfect job of creating in depth physics balancing the environment around it just as perfectly.The Ball physics the cars the arena the 3 dimensional aspect of the game they are all developed to perfection in terms of balance and fairnessBefore the game you most likely already saw how good players play the game Aerials re directs dribbling you name it.Then you start playing the game yourself and you start at the very bottom try to even hit the damn ball!Once you have managed that you try to hit the ball into the direction you approximately want. Then you train yourself to not hit the ball all the time and instead only kick it when it makes sense.You can see where I am going with this there are many many many many small steps to become a better RL player each step is a fun challenge on its own once youve succeeded a step you immidiately feel the success and reward as you are now a more competent player.Once you get to a decent level the game is very fast paced hell even getting ingame is fast paced. Compare it to other Online games like League of Legends where you spend a good 10 minutes even getting into a ranked game. Rocket League takes 1 minute from starting the game on Steam to being in a match.It is a competitive game that could not be more competitive in its nature. Many other competitive games have random aspects to them they have inbalances between the 2 oppositions CSGO has 2 different starting locations and weapons MOBA's have 100+ characters not allowing one to be played twice at the same game RL gives you the exact same starting conditions every game for everyone except the car which has no major impact rather a minor one.Psyonix the developer has done a magnificent job on the game. Not only developing it but also keeping it updated. We constantly see free content updates reasonably priced DLC Psyonix truely cares about its fanbase and it is important to appreciate that as a player.The only downside I can currently think of is server instability which does sadly happen a bit more often than it should other than that there is no big downside to the game.It is not a game for every one despite its popularity. If you're somewhat interested in Racing Games if you're somewhat interested in competitive games you will not have any regrets purchasing this game.If you are not interested in either and have no friends to play it with then I won't give it a definite recommendation.Overall I give this a 9.5/10For more racing game recommendations check out my driving games curator page containing race simulators arcade racing games basically anything with cars and racing. http //store.steampowered.com/curator/9174759 Best of driving games/,Rocket League®,5,821,3323,582,5

10/10/2014,0,0,62,Recommended,This game stands out from the pack from the very begining. Other simulators like the Farming Simulator series are known more for their bad physics than their gameplay but this... this is quite different. The braking for example takes a much longer distance to stop with a 27 tonne load than it does with a small 3 tonne refridgerator van. And turning corners at speed is another thing. In the truck alone you can turn a corner with a fair bit of speed maybe about 70 80 Kph. Taking the same corner with a heavy trailer will make you feel as if you made a mistake. Time feels as if it has slowed when you make this mistake the cab flipping slower than it should and all because of the depth of the game.Even the gameplay sets itself different. Anyone would think that a trucking game could get boring but no. This game refuses to play by the rules. Wanna start in London and make your way through mainland Europe buying properties and drivers along the way? Sure. Go ahead. Wanna forget about that and run your company alone?

12/17/2016,0,0,907,Recommended,"Really good game for 20$ you just got to have some what of patience. Getting raided on a hard worked base is blood boiling but that's the beauty of the game you gotta work hard to achieve what high end players gain from this amazing game. but other than that it's captivaiting graphics amazes me. This game is filled with tons of ways to kill or get killed building a base is the most rewarding killing another with alot of loot is a blessing. I extremely recommend a friend to play with which makes it more fun and easier to progress. Now as for the community it is the most toxic at the moment. That's why you just got to be more friendly your voice and manipulation will be your guide. Try avoiding any heavily geard players alot complain in the reviews about how the community and the unfriendly players are what cause them to not have fun just avoid always stay 1 step ahead of them.Furthermore others also tell how there is no ""beginners tutorial"" when you can easily search on Youtube or Google tips and tricks on how to get better a game like this can't have a ""tutorial"" you gotta just have to think ahead and plan. This game is very fun if you ever wanted to practice you can search up Battlefield servers to practice pvp and team work.Only thing that bothers me is the animals being able to go through stone but can be easily countered by placing a foundation you can stand on and axe/spear it to death it's easier after that.",Rust,5,907,1437,268,5

11/4/2017,2,1,3,Not Recommended,Unless you already have hundreds of hours on the game and know exactly what to do to 110% optimize every movement and start playing with zero sleep on a server every waking minute the moment a server resets you will just get killed dozens of times by griefers until you give up. Welcome to the magical world of a 4 year early access game called Rust. Enemies make no sound when approaching. All weapons kill with 2 hits. When you die you lose everything because people will camp your home and kill you over and over until yet again you give up on trying to play this game.Possibly the worst survival game I've ever played. 4 hours and I've left with the worst taste in my mouth of any game since X Rebirth which was universally hated. This game completely and entirely tailors itself to trolls so that new players will find it impossible to do anything build anything or get anywhere. Literally less than a day into this game and these trolls had guns and fortresses built and just spent their time destroying everyone elses and forcing them to quit the server out of frustration.Seriously do not buy this game if you haven't already played it so much you're a master (a paradox I know with good reason). Legitimately the positive reviews will tell you it's fun and all but like pyramid schemes these reviews are simply there to encourage new players to buy the game get destroyed by the positive reviewers that enjoy tormenting people then have them quit. Congratulations devs you've succeeded in not only facilitating griefing and trolling but tailored the game to facilitate it.,Rust,1,3,1581,279,1

Update After playing for a while I've decided I'm alright with the microtransactions. Trading clothes with friends and selling items on the market is fun. As long as there is a way for players to get the items without paying actual cash for them I can live with this. I'm still not very happy about the key system but I can live with it. This is a great game with a huge community. It's fun and it's worth your time.Original review I really enjoy this game and I love playing it with friends. I unfortunatly cannot in good conscience recommend this game currently. I was about to buy a copy for a friend but I feel I shouldn't now. I'm a bit torn by the news of microtransactions.

2/5/2018,0,0,215,Not Recommended,This game was so great when it first came out... Now it just feels totally different. New content takes weeks upon weeks to release and when it finally is released it is so miniscule that it doesn't make a difference in the grand scheme of things. There are tremendous issues with player movement loot loot boxes lag directional sound etc. The list could go on and on of things that should have been fixed before full release. I played this game from the beginning and I even played the original ArmA 2 Battlegrounds mod which i think had more substance and replayability than this sorry excuse for a full game. Rarely do I ever write reviews this long but this game was such a let down to me that I felt it necessary to share my thoughts on it.

I feel ive given the game a fair assessment and will later rewrite it if the game fixes its major issues (not holding my breath ((h1z1 dayz early access for life) and I hope this game doesnt see consoles at the state its in because I know they plan to realease it there as well. smhEdit As of the last update my game continues to crash randomly before it never crashed Ill restart itll work fine then randomly boop crash.

And after that I don't care about the single player ither because the online version is so bloody brilliant. It's the best balanced combination of driving shooting action and great team play in any game I have ever encountered. You can play it as a typical team shooter with just your friends by doing instanced missions either co op or PvP or you can free roam around the huge map in a variety of vehicles (almost 500 to choose from) and run a full criminal business or jack cargo from other people's businesses for fun and profit )Despite being several years old it's still getting frequent updates and the servers are pretty lively. You do get the occassional childish griefer taking out ""noobs"" for no good reason but by and large the community seems reasonable and you can always server hop easily if someone is being a pain in the I honestly don't think I've ever had this much fun in any other game. 11/10 would shoot cops in a weaponised dune buggy again.",Grand Theft Auto V,5,687,1066,191,5

The devs do an excellent job of keeping players informed on what they are doing and what is coming up in the world of Rust. A lot of people complain about KOS and constant raiding but really if you find the right server and can find some people to play with it is a lot of fun. Rust is all about adaptation and starting anew. If you get too attached to the things you have built up then this may not be the game for you.,Rust,5,447,645,127,5

It's not like you can just hide in a bush like a p***y and ruin a skilled players game. The game has absouloutely no bugs in it and it's ready for the pro scene. A clear example of this is the last game I played where my gun was shooting at the roof when i was clearly aiming at him.

11/10/2017,0,0,13,Not Recommended,"Ok before I start im not saying you can't enjoy this game. I see how it can be fun to some people. This game to me is trash the thing that ruins this game for me is how poorly it runs on my pc. I don't have a beast pc but Its still decent I run games like gta v (which is an old game but it still takes a bit to run) farcry and other games like that at around 60 fps this games textures and graphics aren't even good its silly how you can hide in a bush and camp without being seen. this game has the same the same problem with games like cod the player and environment are to similiar. And if you say that I don't like it because im bad is a silly argument. I play tons of games that I suck at that I enjoy. This game is also boring you can go a whole game without seeing someone then die from someone you don't even see. and yes you can go into more populated areas but this game is mostly luck you can go into a house and only find pants and a shotgun and the house next dorr has a ak and level 3 helmet. so if you do land in the more popular areas you have to pray to god you get something decent. Also the bugs this game is buggy to and if you say ""thats because its early access"" shut the up because early access if just a way to realese a buggy game and make money off of it. Look at ark that game sucked it had similar problems to pubg. It was a buggy game but at least you could have a ton of things to do in it. I don't recommend this game to anyone.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,13,1460,310,1
7/20/2017,0,0,147,Recommended,I have never written a review before but here it goes Pros this game is very fun to play with your friends and makes you focus on your surroundings in order to keep on living... it is quite a unique feeling to be the final 10 alive in a tiny circle and you are just waiting for the right moment to shoot the last person so overall i would say its a really fun game cons this is a wide spread issue if im corret but there is a serious problem with textures right now i have a i5 6500 cpu which is pretty good and a gtx 1060 6gb and 8gb of ram. now i can max pretty much every single game i play and this includes pubg however no matter the setting i have this dumb bug where it takes like 30 seconds to a minute for the building textures to load in which often gets me killed. I've read lots of forums and looked through redit and they all say to upgrad to an ssd or boost my ram to 16gb. now that may make sense to some people but i personally will never beef up my system for one game due to an unoptimized engine. i can max every single other game textures loading fine so i see no reason why this one wont be able to in the future so until then ill just play with friends and die right off the start like usual.Final thoughts if you have an ssd and 16gb of ram then go ahead its a lot of fun. if you have a normal drive and the standard gaming ram of 8gb then maybe hold off until they fix this stupid issue,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,147,1410,291,4

Unfortunately for me I do not handle well in PVP fights and usually end up second best. It is difficult to survive when the larger groups basically hunt you down and have the resources to raid your base in a minute or 2 while you just cower in the corner of your base waiting for it to end.Mining and underground home's with hidden trap doors would be nice ) I dont survive well above ground lolHonestly I would probably still pay $20 today for what it has become.P.S. I have to agree with other reviewers the xp system makes it near impossible to overthrow the dedicated few that spend every living hour ingame. Start a game towards the end of the week spend hours on hours making your base safe and gathering resources and next thing you know the servers going to wipe despite the name of server saying its fresh wiped.Killing &amp Raiding fellow players is the game.,Rust,5,1103,1114,205,5

4/14/2015,0,0,1272,Not Recommended,It's absolutely horrifying how Rockstar managed to turn this once great game into such a pile of garbage. Where do I start? First of all the in game economy is so poorly balanced that you have to grind missions for days upon days to earn any money for the new DLCs. And what happens after you do that? Rockstar applies a blanket money sweep to remove millions of dollars from tens of thousands of innocent players under the false pretense that it is illegitimate money. I myself lost 2.6 million that I grinded for several days due to this moronic decision made by Rockstar. This was cleverly done right before an expensive DLC. Then they great you with a screen that desperately advertises the all new pricing of shark cards (pay to win MTX). This is pathetic for a game that I paid 60 dollars for. The new DLC is a horrible unoriginal and buggy copy paste of so many past DLCS (pick a crate up deliver and sell it for pennies).Also all of my new aircraft upgrades that i paid money for are now gone due to yet another ridiculous bug. Please save yourself some money and avoid all of this headache.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,1272,1099,203,1

7/27/2018,0,0,12,Recommended,Player Unknown's Battle Grounds more commenly known as PUBG is one of the First Battle royale games That blew up. After Brendan Greene started working with the team who created another Battle Royale game Called H1Z1 King Of The Kill he decided he wanted to take is part on the whole Battle royale game and created his own game PUBG. The game gets more hate than it deserves. The cons of it are that there are many hackers Lots of bugs and how unoptimized it is. The Game improved alot since release and has optimised the game. You probably couldnt even run this game on a gt 1030 when the game first came out now you could probably run the game at around 1080p medium settings at 60fps maybe more. People say that he doesnt care about what the consumer wants and only wants to add cosmetics to make more money but its not really true there have been so many problems fixed since launch. Yes the more popular BR Game is Fortnite Battle Royale but player count shouldn't determine which game you should get. I would give this a 8.5/10Edit Most bad reviews are from people with patato pcs or ones who die to bugs alot. dont know if its true because i havent ran into more than 3 bugs in the 30 40 games ive played so far one of them was me getting stuck in the ground and moving very slowly which i fixed by just proning another was trying to pick items up without dragging them into my inventory and the other was just me crashing. if you have a pc over $300 you should be able to play it. hell ive seen it being play with a gt 1030. If people tell you that you cant play it with anything but a $1000 pc dont listen to them. My Laptop has a GTX 1050ti i5 8300h 2.3 ghz multi core processor and 8gb ddr4 ram with a 256gb ssd and the game runs perfectly on high and medium settings. while this is a $800 laptop with taxes included you could probably get the same build in a desktop for around $400 $600,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,12,1898,367,3

12/30/2016,1,3,353,Recommended,Now the only solid reason for me recommending this game is its very successful delivery of both immersion and suspense as well as it being a very fun game to play with friends in both online or private matches. However before purchasing their are some drawbacks you should now about that greatly affect the game's overall quality.Queue times may be long at times and certain loading screens may become forever stuck killers always have priority over the server as the host and this can cause inumerous amounts of lag at times that takes away from the games immersion and one of the biggest drawbacks for me is the fact that currently if a killer were to start the match fully with survivors they have the capability of leaving the match or disconnecting from the match for whatever reason it may be and this unfortunately can cause survivors to lose their offerings or survivor rank due to the match ending but without enough time to gather bloodpoints needed to advance.Certain killers have even exploited this against me and have left the match moments before myself and 2 friends were about to escape the map due to this killer not being able to capture any of us and this of course made us all lose a pip in our survivor rank as well as our offering.So overall the game is very entertaining to play but many issues need to be fix before the playerbase will truly be able to enjoy it.,Dead by Daylight,5,353,1387,249,5

1/8/2017,0,0,5,Recommended,I'm only a few hours in so take my opinion with a grain of salt. For an EA game it's surpisingly stable and solid on a fundamental game engine level. I've had one CTD and I've lost a few materials to bugs. I've also glitched through the map plenty but that's a simple fix when the entire map is terraformable!I would say I've gotten as far as the mid game at this point and I know there are quite a few advanced features I have yet to get to. That said there is a lot of obvious room for expansion of crafting recipes resources tools buildings etc.After everything above I am highly pleased with Astroneer so far and I am already a die hard fan and rooting strong for the devs to keep expanding such an already well made game.,ASTRONEER,3,5,726,140,3

Rocket League brings something for everyone. A fun game for casual players and tons of intricacy and strategy for advanced players. Controls are intuitive and it is very very fun to drive each and every car.

8/21/2018,0,0,271,Recommended,Game is genuinely really good. Technical issues riddle through it and that is a huge issue. Preformance for me specifically is fine and I pretty much have the recommended specs on all highest so that's something. I hear and have seen a lot of others getting hit by dips in fps and cpus running up to 100% for seemingly no reason. I mean this game is pretty but its basically a console texture job so the preformance is completely unwarranted. My issue and the issue that I think is what needs to be addressed post friggin haste is the communication errors. Holy christ almighty they are rampant and they are annoying. I mean its a big game and idk how big Capcom expected this game to be or how much of an audience it expected to pull but this far after release and no patch well let's just say it smells fishy. I will say I think this game has been getting a VERY unfair shake by some communities stemming from *cough*Reddit*cough* and the little lynch mobs they like to employ but they are entitled to their opinions but I will say that KB+M is fine with some tweaking. I found the ranged controls unsavory but not 40% positive reviews unsavory. The preformance is an issue absolutely but again not warranted of the collapsing public opinion this game is experiencing. However I get the sentiment for a $60 game you want things done right. Controller is fine I genuinely don't understand why people are throwing fit after fit becasue of it unless they are using some obscure pad. xbox controllers are adequate if not good. The heart of this game's issue if I had to guess is Denuvo. I loathe Denuvo which isn't an unshared opinion. I am willing to place a lot of the technical issues this game is experiencing at Denuvo's feet and I wouldn't be surprised if that comes out later and Capcom does nothing. I recommend the game but under conditions. This game just does better in my experience in single player. I get it its not the traditional MonHun experience to play alone all day but if its what you were going for anyways then you are in a good place. Another condition is this If it does come out that Denuvo is the cause of 1080 ti's running sub 60 fps or the cause of massive CPU usage spike constant data leaks or those god forsaken communication errors if that comes out and Capcom does not respond accordingly Do not buy this game. If they want to prove that their precious corporate interest and pet DRM is more important in the face of good will and market research then let it be but until then give them a fair shake. Let them actually release a patch of substance before you call for their heads.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,271,2612,480,5

I don't generally call out hax just because I died I am am utter at shooters and no game can have a hacker for each time I die but you kinda know when it's happening right.... that dude headshotting you and the rest of your squad each time even one of you peeks from a different location..... that dude that hits headshots with an AKM on burst at 300m... 4 of them... while yr on a speeding bike.Still having a lot of fun though in the clean matches and looking forward to fewer hackers soon.Would I recommend the game.... well the tension and pace are fantastic and playing with friends is a lot of fun but if you are easily off by the times you meet a cheater wait a little while longer until it's fixed a bit more.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,57,982,194,3

I played for 47 hours the first week I owned it and couldn't get enough of it. The survival aspects of the game are more thrilling when on servers with other players. You build your home to try to survive and those who are blood thirsty will hunt you and raid you in the night I recommned playing with a group of good friends as surviving the elements is easy surviving your fellow man is a chore. The dev's are very open about the game and there are server plugins of all kinds being developed by players good with code. This game can only go anywhere but up in my opinion.,Rust,3,93,718,143,3

These micro transactions are called ""Shark cards"" these cards can give you in game money for real money although this game might be playable without buying any it is hard to do so.I have had this game on a last generation console before it was released for pc before shark cards where a thing and when the shark cards where released i find it hard not to pay up cash in real life to get that dream car i always wanted or to buy that Drug manufacturing place i always wanted or that garage that can store 50+ cars.I do reccomend this game but if you hate micro transactions good luck having to play Gta Online!",Grand Theft Auto V,4,127,1290,231,4

To call this a masterpiece is an understatement to call this anything less than a 9/10 is just ridiculous. The graphics gameplay detail world soundtrack and licensed music are all best in class and come together in the best way possible. Never have I seen an open world so immaculate in detail with an amazing story that stays together plot wise and with an ending I will remember for a long time to come.The ragdoll physics and physics in general are awesome even though it's less than RDR and GTA IV's physics. Three playable protaganists that have there own personality each of which are shockingly human feeling and relatable.

8/21/2018,0,0,235,Recommended,After getting the rainbow pigment 100% the cantena 100% palico gear and grimalkynes getting most of the pets and finishing every story/optional mission and fihting most of the tempered monsters I can say this game is what an 11/10 looks like. This game is overflowing with content yet it's not in your face. It doesn't go out of its way to show it off. You start with a basic story basic weapons fighting basic monsters. But slowly everything gets more complex and rewarding. The combat is crisp and relentless challenging but not impossible. This game is like animal crossing with the collecting systems and Bloodbourne esque combat. This game is Dark Souls but with a soul every level feels alive with monsters that interact with all of the environment. The monster designs are jaw dropping with movesets that are well balanced and fit the character. Even after exploring every corner of every map I don't feel like I'm in the same place every time I go out with new footprints different monsters having turf wars different pets spawning different items available different weather and different objectives that overlap flawlessly. I haven't sunk into a game like this in a long time and the last MH i played was freedom 2 on the psp in 2007 and boy has it grown up. This game is worth it to play with friends (if the servers work) it's worth it for the campaign and story or to just have satisfying solo combat against some of the best bosses I've ever faced. This game is no Bloodbourne for difficulty IF you do your research and learn the combat gear items. But this game also tells you everything you need to know to succeed. But you'll still get Anjanathed through trees or bombed from the sky or die to Nergigante 21 times until you grind better gear because you have to and it's not called Fashion Hunter World then you solo 0 faint it... It's especially worth it if you want to 100% amazing games. Well good luck with this one even trying to 100% pets food quests 1 type of weapons tree and armor sets to go with it you're looking at hundreds of hours with good rng and playing well. Theres 14 weapons 5 elements 31 large monsters with 3 sets of armor each do the math. The only cons I've had with this game are networking related which has gotten much better especially with record numbers of players. The other is performance not mine (4770k + 1070 gets avg 80 90 with tweaks and only dips to 40s 50s teostra thunder weapons) but players with laptops or much older cpus will struggle. Most modern rigs with the settings on low high will be fine. As far as controls you WILL have to rebind them if you plan on mouse and keyboard (aim for bow was v not right click?).

Judging from how insanely supportive and proactive the developers are I'd say the fixes will come sooner rather than later. The game has been out for what... a month? They've already released several good patches the most recent of which is an absolute delight and improves dramatically upon nearly every aspect of the game.

10/30/2016,0,0,271,Recommended,Product received for free. This is more a comparison of regular and special edition of skyrim. Pro's Better graphics Specificly blood water grass body and face textures look better than vanilla (its nothing compared to modded skyrim though) Better performance Its almost constantly at 60 fps only dropping between loading screens for a brief moment. No crashes lag freeze ups or major issues. Short loading screens I have experienced very short loading screens only times I get long loading screens is when I fast travel long distances and even then it is only 10 20 seconds. Fallout 4 save system Basicly we can make different characters and it automaticly switches saves makes it easy to make different characters without needing to worry about saves. Counts as a different game in your library from normal edition Basicly your saves mods and achievements and everything else is not shared between SE and normal edition so SE could be a clean slate if you have the old skyrim and broke it with too many mods. Cons Mods disable achievements Yeah Bethesda did it again. You can get a mod on the nexus to re enable them with mods but its worth mentioning. Not as many mods as skyrim This is the main downside to SE. For PC skyrim has far more mods than SE (but mod authors are working on making SE versions of their mods. Frostfall ordinator unofficial patches and others are already here and more are coming. People are having problems with the game. There are people that experience slow fps long loading screens frequent crashes and other issues. I have not had those issues but it is worth mentioning. So should you buy SE or regular? Do you have original skyrim for PC? Maybe not.Do you not have original skyrim or you're on console and you want the mods that SE will give you? YES go buy it. It is a great game especially with mods and mod authors are converting more and more mods from the old to the new.

(actually 2 one as Leon and one as Claire where you can play a third version as a slightly different outcoming) I have yet to play the second storyline (Claire) so I have to find out yet what this brings. And for the third story I must be honest that I don't feel thrilled about it to play it since it only differs a bit from the original one.Overal I should give this game a 8/10 rating for the fun I had.I defenitly recommend this game but keep the short story in mind when buying.

3/13/2017,0,0,440,Not Recommended,"The game used to be fun but it's getting really annoying when every update the developer does revolves around their crates&amp keys microtransations. They add boring skins over the standard map design in order to promote a new crate and get people to spend money on keys to open them. A ""Spring crate "" you're joking right?What's really annoying is that it would be really easy for them to show that they're not money hungry and obviously completely focused on getting players to throw money into their key system. For instance it takes a long time to go up a single level and it would be easy to at least reward people with a key this route. Also the failing joke that is tournaments failed because there is literally no incentive to play it compared to competitive.My friends and I put a lot of time into the game but it's getting dry every update when they add an unneccessary map with a new crate to buy.

I'm a rabid Civ fan. I have about 3K hrs in Civ 4 and 2K into Civ 5. What about Civ 6? I find it boring. Again I'm not going to get into specifics it's a gut feeling kind of thing.

4/1/2014,0,0,71,Recommended,Rust to me is the backdrop of Fallout 3/NV and the building mechanics Minecraft that has some of the beautiful elements of Far Cry 3. All great things and what hopefully is the start to an amazing game when it finally sheds it's Alpha build state.I think Rust could be the best MMO I've ever played because I personally don't like any MMO's but something about Rust that works mainly because of it's life like rules and harsh realism. From the moment you wake to the inevitable moment you die (or be killed) you're constantly trying to survive and better your gaming life. Time balance and fun.The sad part is I'm not sure if the game will ever be fixed beyond what it is and improved because it seems already that a lot of work has gone into this 'value' priced game and will take a lot more work to both fix and improve.Technical issues small and brightly coloured text on light backgrounds networking lag on busier servers (yet it says they are at 1% capacity) terrible shadow shimmering/flickering on everything controls are a bit odd (holding down E and also use mouse/trackball to click in another menu is not user friendly) can't scroll with mouse/trackball to select anything can't search for certain server graphical collisions and physics seems too random at times and the moment you 'touch' water (sea/rivers/etc) you instantly drown and die.Though in general the game looks impressive runs without crashing the sound atmosphere is almost perfect (breaking stuff is too loud for yourself to hear though) survival methods feel balanced and the day cycle (sunrise to sunset is truly amazing). Graphically it reminds me of playing GTA IV (2009) 'unmodded' now where it still looks pretty impressive but then it also looks old and in need of graphical TLC ...textures for one!In random order these are the gaming faults of 'Rust' I feel that should change or fixed Weather variations (rain thunder storms snow wind extreme weather moments etc) a lot more wildlife on ground level and skies (harmless and harmful) needs to be added smoke from fires should be seen further way (white and black smoke) advance guns needs to be 'removed' as this breaks it's realism in this type of survival game textures for trees rocks doors etc need much improving (looks to low res/pixelated and old school) you should be able to swim in shallow water and even fish (when the right equipment has been made of course) insects should be randomly around (ground level and flying) plantation should be greatly a part of all this tree fruits (shake tree to gain fruits) the ability to talk to those you are near you 'only' in the game (others too far can't hear you or read your typed messages maybe an indication for those a little to far saying Insert Players Name Said something but was too far to heard or read etc) The Ui should be scalable as it's a little too small to read the Ui should have the ability to be transparent (amount set by user) Inverted Ui colours at night the ability to build and use a compass (can be seen in the Ui maybe) you should be allowed to make your own bare skin character (basic is fine but at least something) the ability to climb trees with a balance gauge so if you mess it up you fall and break something even faster sprint running that only last for brief moments foot prints recently left by others ability to dig (though I'd image this would complicated and change the game too much) ability to throw rocks (you don't need guns in this sort of game it's stupid really) accidentally setting fire to things (but they go out fast otherwise it will be too much of game change) ability to drink and gather water does anyone use the loo in some form on Rust player origin country flags or symbols self created maps (when your able to write on paper or similar with charcoal for example) write on rocks with charcoal or similar (but vanishes or is washed away with rain over time) fighting with others barehanded (no weapons) barehanded fights are balanced by you physical strengths (food consumed exercise fat etc) and lastly ...genders ...I only see men and NO WOMEN ...WtF?!? ...What kind of island is this?!?!?OK that was my random and late review which is months over due but it wasn't something I could just say without truly playing this 'huge' 'expansive' and original MMO type game. If your wondering it's a lot better than Nether and 7 Days to Die but I've yet to try and play DayZ which I believe is very different and not as raw and real as Rust.*2/3* I recommend Rust but sadly feel it's not going to get much better than it is and not include any of what I've said above.Note Rust does not work to well in Stereo 3D (lots shading and lighting issues) and will probably be an issue with VR headset such as Oculus __ ...one day I hope it will though!,Rust,3,71,4783,856,3

I will no longer be playing this game. There are so many things wrong with this game that im not even going to waste half an hour writing about everything. All i'll say is if you bought this game then im sorry you wasted your money and for those of you who havent bought this game yet then i urge you not too unless you like having a terrible experience or playing terrible games.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,250,691,132,1

The loadtimes are so much faster and being able to turn off the fog really makes the game look clean (as well as run much better). I have not had one crash and nearly zero performance problems.

1/31/2016,0,0,12,Not Recommended,The game had great mechanics and entriely the driving experience felt smooth overall. I even found the driving experience so smooth that I wasn't concentrated on jerking motions from the car and rather the turns focused my vision on the playing field instead of my position. The wide turns could sometimes be annoying but this I found to be fundamental for the positioning aspect that I aforementioned was backed up by a great driving experience. What more could you want in a competitive/casual car game? Well I found myself after playing Rocket League slowly not wanting to play it again. I couldn't place my finger on any true issue with mechanics or gameplay but effect of after playing a round was unsatisfying. If asked by my friends to play a round of Rocket League I was hesitant at first. I can tribute this very much to the experience I felt when playing PAYDAY 2 in such that when I open the game now the excitement of playing it was already lost (now having 24 hours in the game). Nothing truly takes me back to wanting to play Rocket League and I only have 2 hours in the game. So if I were to reccomend the game to a friend I wouldn't be quite sure what to say. Games like CS GO have me constantly wanting to play another match after I am done with the previous one but Rocket League just doesn't. Maybe the game can give a more capturing feel sense of more achievement or non monotonmous races (never once was I on the edge of my seat playing Rocket League). I can't exactly say Rocket League is a bad game but I would not feel happy classifying it as good game either in my personal opinion. So I guess it is a opinion that should determine the purchase of the game.,Rocket League®,1,12,1682,313,3

1/2/2018,0,0,244,Recommended,The game is extremely choppy and it seems to get worse when another player is near you in the game. Lag is a big problem on OC server i shot a player with full burst micro UZI he didnt die then he shoots me once with pistol I die. this was all at close range I was obviously lagging behind the other player. The game needs to match the ping of players. If a players ping is to long then he shouldnt be aloud to connect. Chinese and Other Asian countries jump on OC server because their servers are full. this should not be a choice. If their server is full they shouldnt then be able to flood the OC server. I know this game is still virtually under construction but these are problems that if not fixed many wont return to play.

This probably makes you wonder why I dont recommend it right? Well thats because of the community. The game is amazing but what ruins it is the majority of the players. People will kill you when you dont even have anything worth taking or do not pose any threat. You will spawn in and soon as you wake someone waste their bullets just to kill you and gain literally nothing but a rock and a torch. The people make this game annoying and a pain to play. You will spend hours building up a base just for someone to walk by blow it up take nothing from it kill you then destroy your spawn and leave. This game has no rules to counter that and it really sucks. I didnt listen to the people warning me about this games community and I was so wrong not to.

If you don't get into the game the system will kick you out and make you queue up again. Queue should not have to be entered multiple times the player should remain in the queue until he or she finds a game. Easy ways to exploit the blood system in multiplayer No blood given for playing with friends as the killer. (And while I realize that allowing this would allow some serious exploits they could have given a seperate bloodpool for offline play so you and your friends can still play together and level up in a different manner.)Overall I think this is a great game but certainly not for everyone. I'd recommend watching some videos before you get it just to make sure it boasts the type of gameplay you're looking for.

3/7/2014,0,0,47,Recommended,"Imagine thisYou awake alone in a forest. You are naked and armed only with a rock and basic survival knowledge. In the distance you hear a man singing near some shack. As you wander around you encounter many rundown buildings some with remaining loot. Suddenly you are attacked by a naked man with a rock screaming wildly. You try to give him chance to surrender but he knows that he has nothing to lose. After a deep breath and some applied pressure the naked man is dead. With all his sounds you did not hear the wolf approaching and now you have a hole in your side and a hungry canine chasing you. Further down in a canyon you spot a well managed structure so you run in and block the door. You find some supplies not much but enough for a home of your own. You managed to survive the following weeks by hiding in the mountains only coming down to get supplies. You have built yourself a shack here a tiny hut that by all standards is a piece of crap but hey that is your home. You return one night from a day of hunting and gathering to rest in your little shack and cook up some chicken. Suddenly you hear something quite unusual the sound of rapid construction outside your door. You open it to find a entire room blocking access to the outside world. You try to bust down the walls but they are built to last. You have a shimmer of hope as you hear a singular voice from outside the walls calling to you in a friendly manner... but then they start singing... ""Oh! Mr. Shack Man!!!! I have trapped you and we will be together forever! OH!!! Mr. Shack Man! you will slowely starve and I will wait out here!""... the singing never stops... and for 2 hours the crazed singing man circled the shack... banging on the walls with a rock... taunting you with his freedom... so finally you make a decision... you are not going to let him have his fun... you take one last look around at the shack that had been home so long... and you commit suicide...You awake in the middle of a forest... naked... armed with a rock and basic survival knowledge... in the distance you hear a man sing love songs to a shack... and a wolf closes in for a meal",Rust,3,47,2140,407,3

9/23/2018,0,0,446,Not Recommended,I really love this game but it is so broken i dont know where to begin. To be honest it should still be i Beta. The most critical thing to me is the netcode/desync issues. I have countless of times encountered enemy's that i have been shooting fullauto with blood flying everywhere but still being the one ending up dead with the enemy just hitting me once or twice. I have encountered times where it felt like the enemy prefirered at me not knowing i was there. But when i watched deathcam he has been well passed the corner and probably saw me long before i saw him. To me it feels more or less like a lottery when in a gunfight who's going to walk out of it alive. And there's tiny things bugging the crap out of me. For an example trying to jump out of a window when being chased but all you do is end up standing by the edge of the window jumping like an idiot. My advice for people thinking about buying is to wait. This game is absolutely on of the most fun games i know but at the same time the worst because of all problems with it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,446,1041,206,1

1/2/2016,0,0,612,Recommended,Have played this game for months on PS4 and am now diving into the PC version due to a few annoying issues with the PS4 version (which I won't bother getting into here). I'll give a brief rundown of a few pros and cons of this great game.Pros Addictive Fun Gameplay This game is simply a blast to play. It is one of those games that you'll tell yourself you'll play for an hour and then 6 hours later it's 3am and you're still going. The game controls really well the physics are mostly very good and it's a game that you feel you can constantly improve at and get just a little better and play a little smarter as you learn it which keeps you motivated. Beautiful Graphics Other than a few small missteps this is an impressive looking game particularly the backgrounds of the various stadiums. Great Soundtrack The music in the menu screens is just phenomenal there's nary a weak track to be found. I'll sometimes loiter in the menus longer than I should just because I don't want to stop listening to the music.Cons Ranking System is Terrible This is the one big flaw with the game. It's just a horrible attempt at a ranking system that honestly defies logic. Basically you gain and lose the same ranking points at game 1 as you do at game 10 000 which makes zero sense in a ranking system. Your ranking should fluctuate heavily in your first 50 or so games before slowly settling into a zone and the points you get from each match declining as your ranking gains more weight. Instead you have to grind your way up the rankings from the very beginning gaining a meager 6 8 points for your first win when you should be gaining 100+. Community Elements Are Lacking In Game There are no online teams or any kind of online leagues or tournaments in the game which is a huge disappointment (you can play a season mode offline). There isn't even any kind of in game friend system or easy way to invite a player to a party you're forced to use PS4/Steam's features to get a player into your group. Game Can be Humbling This is a game that can make you feel like a complete dolt at times as you inexplicably whiff on a ball you were sure you had lined up.Would definitely recommend this game to just about anybody even those who don't typically like sports or team games as it's so unique and entertaining that it deserves a look.,Rocket League®,5,612,2324,433,5

12/13/2018,1,1,196,Not Recommended,Okay I am gonna say this right now.I enjoyed the f*** out of this game right until version 1.0They not only made the glitches worse but also introduces things like broken matchmaking a billion hackers and unbalanced guns.The games drag out way too long and just aren't fun you collect loot for 10 minutes then you walk get shot or shoot someone and walk some more.This could be forgiven tho but instead of fixing this the devs just keep making it worse and worse every single patch.First there came a second map which was fine until you realize you can't choose which map you play then came the third which was fun but they also introduced micro transactions battle passes and even more glitches and performance issues with the fourth map on the horizon It isn't looking all that good.But the biggest problem of them all is the fact that they made a even called Fix PUBG an event designed for fixing the game. this is already bad but after 4 months and the event ending they fixed less than 10% of the bugs.The game still isn't optimized has glitches hackers drags out way too long and has more micro transactions than fifa.Instead of fixing this they just keep adding guns thinking its fresh and exciting while you still just disconnect mid game from time to time.Please PUBG you were great but you ruined everything you had going for you.Thanks for (reading).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,196,1361,242,1

I started off wanting the old legacy back but in actual fact I think I speak for most people when I say the new Rust is a lot better. If I could play this Rust (with the building guns features etc) on the legacy map then I would switch in a heart beat but the fact every world is unique and generates new seeds (much like Minecraft) is pretty awesome to explore.The developers work extreamely hard to release more and more content each and every week.

The quality of life changes that this game brought with it are very welcome. The constant addition of events and updated/new monsters keep the replayability of the game high enough to keep me coming back. The myriad of weapons available always give you the option to change the way you play if you ever get bored.Admittedly the game does get a little stale after a little while but it's still fun with friends and you're free to open yourself up to a new playstyle to fight the monsters all over again if you wish.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,667,675,122,5

12/1/2017,0,0,23,Not Recommended,"I would recommend this game but I won't due to following reasons.1.) Horrible terrible optimization. Sometimes when landing on ground buildings aren't even fully rendered and I can just walk through walls and then it lags out or I get stuck. Overall optimization of the game is just awful. No excuse. I have a mid tier PC and I'm having huge issues playing this game sometimes. And I've heard people with beastly PCs sometimes can't run it smoothly on higher graphics.2.) Clunky. Game just feels clunky all the time. Sometimes you have to press mulitple times (interact) with a door for it to respond so it opens or closes. Picking up loot from the ground sometimes is harder than it looks. Gotta press ""F"" multiple times for my character to react and take the damn loot. Shooting sometimes feels clunky and movement of the game overall. Nothing feels nice and smooth.3.) Lootcrates in early access. I hate being that guy but I mean it's still early access. Focus on your freaking optimization instead of how to milk more money.I would keep on going but I prefer to stick with these 2 major issues above. Game has more issues from what I heard from veterans so read more reviews if you want info on those.Honestly this game has lots of potential.

10/8/2016,0,0,38,Not Recommended,"This is an entertaining and fun game for people who are naturally ""gifted"" at video games in the talent or skill accrual departments. I most certainly am not . The music in this game is nice the premise of the game is great and it's attractive and colorful but the problem with multiplayer games if you just aren't good or able to ""git gud"" as they say is that you're just screwed and going to exist as a stepping stone for the success of your opponents and a pebble in the shoe of your more skilled team mates annoying them that you're slowing them down.If you aren't talented or able to get good hastily this game will wound your pride while inspiring rage and envy in you by the bucketload as you watch other players perfectly rocket up off of the field to hit the ball into the goal from above while you try and fail HUNDREDS of times to do the same. It took me about 36 hours to pull that off once and I did it by accident when I succeeded not one I could repeat either mind you. Unless you're naturally good at games or just want to be filled with negative emotions and 50 CCs of butt hurt then I would highly urge you to avoid this game or only watch other people play it online if it interests you that much.",Rocket League®,1,38,1216,236,1

Even with the worst spawn you can make your way to the top by playing it smart.+ Fast paced matched (30minutes max) Might be con for some. They can still feel slow if you like camping playstyle.+ First person mode and third person mode for variety of gaming they feel completely different and fresh from each other.+ Static weathers variety rain fog and about three different sun levels. Now there are two maps!+ Dedicated DEV's with long lifespan planned for the game.+ Vaulting was something I never expected to like makes looting way more enjoyable.Cons Somewhat broken HITREG shoot someone find out in killcam you never shot really annoying. Game doing stuff like hitreg and smokes for example on clientside leads to conflicted firefights. Performance issues/Optimization issues large fixed out but still not best 70 105 fps GTX 1070 i7 3770 8gb RAM in 31.12.2017 SSD or high amount of fast RAM is almost a must have. Do not believe the minimum system requirements as of 30.10.2017 The developer has broken some word's about adding microtransactions during the EA period of the game. This might be a minor con for some people and major to others if you care about developers complete transparency and integrity. Constant fixes on games optimizations that get broken after few patches only to be repaired to same state and not improved upon. Rng ""Algorithm"" on this game seems broken mostly noticable when map gets selected you can easily get either map 5 times in row loot piles being same items. Unbalanced BP rewards from different party modes it makes no sense to gain 700 bp from top 10 solo and 170 from top 10 squad mode games take similar amounts different kind of effort to win but doesnt justify huge difference like this. Official 1.0 release was a complete joke just a way for the devs to get community off their back while piling usual ""weekly updates"" into one bigger patch. Bugs are rampant.Neutral 00 Clear concept of a game with clear path to launch and beyond 2018 we have a celar roadmap now!0 Not able to select the maps/map variety you want to play can be bothersome.0 New lobby system is way better than the old one can still get some work done.0 Gun skins some variety but not much good for people who care about these tho! What does that make of the game? Bumpy as hell early access period with somewhat okay launch good features added but the game didn't feel like release yet more like polished early access title.Will this great early access success last beyond the bumpy release? Probably but it does not feel like it is a real release yet.Recommended even after mostly negative opinions for past year of the games early access period. The game has a promising future with fun as hell gameplay as for now.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,366,3272,573,1
4/14/2015,0,0,163,Recommended,Rating Awesome 8/10GTA 5 as its predecessors its a high profile game where Rockstar clearly spend lots of time and money to create an ultimate gaming experience. However there is couple goods and bads that i will point out in this review and hopefully you guys can make your own mind wether the game deserves your hard worked $$$ or perhaps its better to spend it somewhere else. I will make couple references to Watch Dogs as comparisment where appropriate. As most of the future GTA 5 PC players most likely played that game which set a really good standard in my opinion when it comes to open world games in this genre.Graphics 8/10R* did a great job to create good visual effects. Settings plate with lots of variety of options will leave you speechless. Starting where you can regulate density of cars pedestrians to even tessalation or antialaising. Anything rain snow sunshine looks extremly real and you will be positively blown away.On the downside even that it is a high quality decent graphics a much better been already shown in other similar game Watch Dogs in my opinions which frankly require a much powerful rig to run it on high settings than GTA 5.Gameplay 8/10The gameplay is very stable and realistic. I used to play a lot Watch Dogs in the past and Watch Dogs was a very dynamic game where you literally could go full commando mode very high paced combat movements driving parkour skills etc. I dont have the same feeling here in GTA 5. As said earlier the game is very realistic that feels like a time slows down a bit while comparing it to WD. It still maintain the same pace as GTA 4 had so people who jumped straight from GTA 4 to GTA 5 will feel like at home. But as a GTA fan i certainly found no issues with switching. The combat however looks very simple i seriously think that R* could use mechanics that were present in Max Payne 3.But then again...who would buy MP3 then...Atmosphere/Story/Feeling/Screenplay 7/10I dont quite find myself well in GTA 5 world. Although there is a strong interaction and history between a player and ingame characters the game lacks some kind of signature touch that were present in for example Alan Wake or Max Payne 2 (both made by Remedy and MP2 with R* partnership) where actually developers created a world that was highly interactive such as stopping by a screen to watch a video scary music played etc. I really miss that here. But i guess its me. For all others who came purely for action robbing banks and ranking up in crime society it will be a heaven.Music 10/10Both in game radio stations cutscene and ambience music and sounds are great. Huge variety of genres to listen to R* never failed here. Amazing job. And of course own mp3 radio station. Cant wait for Frag Radio plugin )Final thoughts As a next installment in GTA generation the game delivers the high quality game which you will enjoy for hours. I hope my review will be me helpful to you to decide wheter you should get the game. But i will say this That game should be on your bucket list for sure.,Grand Theft Auto V,4,163,3037,547,4

3/28/2017,0,0,28,Recommended,I have never ever touched a BattleRoyal game because i have never feeled the joy of it but after PUB released their Early Access and the explosion of streamers streamed it. I thought i NEED to read about this game stalked the /r/PUBATTLEGROUNDS/ and read about how the health of the game was. Watching beginner guides on YouTube.I decided to give it a go to jump in to the BR gamestyle.After around 10 hours in to the game i'm having a blast. It's so intense it's so fun Solo or Duo.Early Access you say? How is it? The first optimization patch will arrive 14th April and it cant come any sooner. It does need to optimize the game. They are improving the servers every day but during peakhours here in Europe it do does lag with rubberbanding effect to it.It's a slight delay when opening doors or while looting it's like a small lag or not as a lagg more like a delay of the action. It does need to improve but the game runs on a UE4 engine so i'm not worried. They are doing a great job so far.It can only get better.I do recomend it! 5/5!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,28,1041,199,3

And that is what takes it away from the older gtas. I have played gta 4 and i loved it. But then when i played gta 5 it opened up a whole new world for me.

1/4/2018,0,0,15,Not Recommended,It feels like it should be a good game. There are lots of matches and the matchmaking is quicker than CS GO (for Australians). I just feel that more should have been done with the concept of the game. Running around a dessert and picking up weaponry/armor/etc to gain the advantage over whoever you find. It's fun in a sense. Obviously people have found a way to have fun with it. I just think it's so cheap feeling that it's a bit of waste of money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,15,450,86,1

1/4/2019,0,0,238,Recommended,Single Player is fun and overall a great time! Most online DLCs are also fun and are able to maintain my interest but they are a bit expensive which attempts to make the weak willed buy shark cards or cheat. (Therefore getting banned and forcing them to spend 60 at one point to regain access to online.) The game runs great on PC but the graphics are partially lacking in some areas. (But my monitor is from like 2007 so it may just be a lack of anti aliasing) but buy this game on a current gen console. I'm on my 3rd PC account now because the temptation to cheat is far too high. Buy this game on console and make it impossible to cheat and it's 10/10.but the game is good i guess,Grand Theft Auto V,5,238,684,134,5

I've ran in a horde of rock wielding cave men and fought men with guns or even just to fight over a pig or two. It's a little like Rags to Riches. You start out a literally naked man with just a rock. Scavenging cloth and other items and gathering meats you become a real survivor. Eventually you'll find guns and advanced gathering tools and kevlar armor dominating all who disbelieve in your authority. It's a hell of a ride and is playable with or without friends.

2/21/2014,0,0,96,Recommended,Rust is highly entertaining and fun in the fact that you get to run around a small/medium sized map killing scavenging and coming across the odd naked fresh spawns wielding rocks. The survival side of the game is enjoyable and it's fun being able to build big base's with friends and conquer your foes with either low quality made weapons or heavy duty weapons such as the shotgun or M4.If you are going to buy the game you must be able to throw all your friendlyness you possess out of the window and just gun down anything you see moving. The players will not give you a chance to survive so don't give them a chance.Furthermore the only thing that let's this game down for me is the new update which removed zombies added wolves and bears with unfair health and damage stats and messed up the whole roleplay of the survival game. I'm truly hoping in the coming updates they improve this.,Rust,3,96,890,163,3
8/28/2018,0,0,254,Recommended,Despite all the network issues the game is experiencing MHW is a good game. Combat is fun and varied the environments are good looking and the monsters are cool. The story isn't anything amazing but it's fine for what it is as a vehicle to move you from place to place. There's definitely a learning curve but it's not overbearing either. I will say that there are some issues with textures in places expecially in cutscenes (for me anyway) and a few fights have some pretty seriou sperformance issues (Whirlwinds anyone?) On the upside it usually looks good plays good and is fairly forgiving. So go ahead feel like major bada** and hunt some monsters! You'll be glad you did.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,254,677,120,5

5/1/2015,0,0,242,Recommended,The game is great wonderful storyline to it with a great 3 characters to play as and since it is released for PC you can play with mods which make the game even more exciting and intense. The only main big issue to me is the intense lag spikes. I have a decent computer that can run more than the minimum requirements says on Steam I am able to run on High and Ultra but for some reason after 30 to 40 minutes of playing in game I start to experience small lag spikes that become stronger and stronger as I keep playing and about a minute after the lag spikes started I get about 1 FPS and it doesn't change unless I restart my GTA and play again this kind of issue really bothers me and is a flaw to any kind of game that has this. I have heard from my friends that some of them do not have the same issue as I do so I am quite curious if any other of you guys out there have the same issue as me because I really experience great discomfort and cannot play the game anymore and just wish that I can play without any lag. Is my graphics card the problem or is there some sort of bug/glitch in the game which causes lag for no reason. Someone please explain but over all the gameplay would be an 8/10 but after 40 minutes 2/10. This game still gets a positive but I will not play this game anymore if Rockstar does not fix this issue.

Really love where the game is right now even though I would gladly go back to BP system but that's a thing of the past. I would definately reccomend the game to someone who wants to build up a base and have tons of fun in PvP wherever you turn. I really enjoy this game and would reccomend it to anyone looking to buy it especially if you have a few friends to play with going up against everyone else solo is quite difficult when you don't have many hours. There is a level of toxicity in the game on most servers so it comes as a very pleasant surprise when you get nice people running up to you and helping you out for no particular reason. Playing this game has been great and I'm wondering how it's still in alpha and think this game deserves more players. I'm gonna hit that thumbs up button for this crafting PvP building all around awesome game.Edit When I said there was a certain level of toxicity in the game I meant it. Most of the community is very toxic and kind of ruin the game for me there's also the dominant zergs that stop small groups from playing on high population servers which really is starting to annoy me as I'm a lover of combat in all forms from stone age weapons to high quality rifles.,Rust,5,1888,1534,288,5

11/12/2017,0,0,334,Not Recommended,PUBG has a long way to go to become an e sport and you shouldn't hope for too much from this gaming anomaly 1. 30 tick rate is garbage. PUBG servers hand deliver slices of gameplay at a rate comparable to that of your newspaper delivery boy.2. Client side hit detection is fundamentally broken for twitch shooters. You can look forward to being owned by lag owning people with lag and hackers from the far east climbing *all* the way up your butt. Bluehole have unlearned the lessons given to us by Quakeworld in 1997 and it hurts.3. Cheaters are especially painful in a sudden death game. Players will walk away. You should walk away. Your time is more valuable than this. You will be ESP d aim botted double teamed fisted and urinated on and they ll have you actually wondering if it was all your fault.4. Random elements have too much influence on gameplay. The circle will own you far more than players. Lack of vehicles will own you. Lack of armour and meds will own you. You will be owned by everything you can t control. You will have a sniper rifle with a red dot. You will find accessories for all the weapons you haven t got. Roll a die. Did you win? Congratulations! You re having more fun than playing PUBG.5. The pace is to too fast for strategic play. Found a good strongpoint? Who cares? Circle is moving. Wounded a player behind a tree? Give up circle is moving. Just won a tense 10 minute stand off? Doesn t matter you re going to die circle is 7km away.6. Ballistics are garbage. Nothing about the way weapons shoot is realistic. You are unlearning how to shoot by playing this arcade nonsense. Don t lead a car even an inch. Don t compensate for drop even with a crossbow. Nothing makes sense but they re hoping you won t notice. Screw them download ACE and play Arma3 instead.7. The Battle Royale market is set to be flooded by better executed games by companies who possess a single clue. This is an amateurish attempt at a pro game by a guy whose resume amounts to an Arma3 and a H1Z1 mod. Dude I get it we all tried our best with the Arma3 engine but four years of sucking out of that particular hose does not entitle you to an instant win lottery ticket just because you downloaded the Unreal Developer Kit.

9/17/2016,0,0,1037,Recommended,A great game we like to hateI really enjoy playing GTA V I have been playing it since 2013 on my Xbox 360 and have more than 1000 hours on the PC version alone. Back in 2013 GTA V did nothing wrong it was the perfect game. But since then many people began to see its flaws and eventually the downfall of GTA Online.Story ModeThe story mode in GTA V is quite enjoyable I liked the 3 characters but I know many others didn't. Being able to switch between characters is a cool idea and in this case well executed. It added a lot of depth and made the world seem more alive than ever. While driving all sorts of different cars you would see airplanes flying citizens walking around and talking to each other random events triggering and a lot more.But it's not all good and fun almost all of the story missions are heavily scripted making it much less enjoyable on your second playthrough but also eliminating frustrating moments like that damned train in GTA San Andreas Exchange from GTA III or the final mission of GTA Vice City. All these scripted moments look incredibly cool but once you notice they are all scripted and realize that Rockstar is holding your hand through the entire game it will become boring and stale really fast.The story is kind of all over the place and full with lucky coincidences and it doesn't have the rags to riches feel. The main characters are all well done in my opinion as always is the voice acting is done well. The map is not as big as in GTA San Andreas but it is more detailed and filled.OnlineGTA Online was and still kind of is a great addition. It makes it possible to play GTA V with up to 32 players. Unlike GTA IV there is a money system. Almost everything costs money I thought it was a great idea. Keep people playing for more cars planes houses etc but since 2015 the prices began to rise.Everything became expensive to make people buy microtransactions to buy money with money (Shark Cards). People started grinding heists to earn as much money as possible. Hackers started invading online lobbies making it hard to find friendly people. If you were AFK for 10 minutes or something a hacker would come by and give you loads of money and the next day you would get banned for getting too much money in a certain amount of time...Now we're at a point where the most expensive car is almost 3 million GTA$ and yachts that can cost 10 million GTA$ (More than 80 euro's in Shark Cards). People flying with bikes and cars randomly killing players. An orbital cannon that can instakill someone if you're willing to pay a hefty price.Rockstar still adds random vehicles new game modes and clothing items to the game. It's still a lot of fun to mess around in GTA Online but try to stay out of public lobbies.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,1037,2749,506,5

1/21/2014,0,0,38,Not Recommended,"Not worth the money at this point full of hackers not much content and the game is overrun with hackers cheaters and power abusing administrators. If your not one of these three types of player then you're entire point in the game is to give those players someone to annoy grief and taunt (via a voice chat that you can't disable) you constantly. Even the players that don't cheat grief or taunt you will still kill you partly because the community around Rust is just that bad but mostly because the game REQUIRES it of them. They cannot trust other players ever and have no way of knowning if you are really a new naked player or if you're carrying an invisible shotgun. I did manage to have a great time playing this game with my friends on an otherwise empty server but that server went down and all of our progress was lost so we decided to try a populated server only to find that it was a completely pointless thing to do. There is no place on a server with more than 10 people where you will be left alone long enough to gather the materials needed to make even a basic house... and even if you somehow DO manage to build yourself a little castle with a stout metal door it won't last the night because ""bandits"" wait for you to log of so that they can go to your base blow it up with C4 murder you in your sleep take all of your stuff then destroy your ability to respawn. Yes that is right the griefers can grief you even when you're not playing!!PVE servers are not the answer either because they do not protect you from ""raiders"" (e.g. 12 year olds who have figured out how to dupe C4) that will blow up your house and steal all of your stuff.

12/9/2018,0,0,4,Not Recommended,I mean the game itself is pretty good but horrible optimization. I mean i got this game (it is one of the most costy games i have bought) hoping that it would run at least a bit (for my friend it runs really good even though he has just a bit better pc than i do) but even with everything on low even putting down resolution it still runs at a crap 14 FPS. I like the game on mobile that is i have an ipad air which is pretty old and it runs just well so cant this optimisation be put on PC? i mean like i understand that there are people with good pcs and all but when it can run smoothly with bad graphics on mobile why not PC? It is just unplayable also having everything on low will make the resolution so bad that you wont even see people in the distance only as some pixels. So yea this is really a bit unfair of a review but they should give at least a low specs mode. This is also what i hate about unreal engine it really requires a beefy PC to run most games. I did everything to make it run as fast as possible but it just doesnt want to. If they would optimise it i would recommend them to look at the resolution because playing at a low 3D resolution makes up for a crap experience. Sometimes it runs good for like 25 FPS for like 5 minutes but then when i go to combat it just breaks and lags out for 4 seconds and the other guy kills me. I cant even get a refund because i have the game sitting for like 2 months in the library and played it for roughly 5 hours trying it to get to work.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,4,1502,310,1

8/13/2017,0,0,349,Not Recommended,Back in June 2014 is when I first purchased and devoted my life to the legacy version known as Rust (Alpha).I may not have as many hours as some others who have posted here but let me tell you why.I loved the Legacy version of this game it ran fine on my old 'gaming laptop' with 8gb of ram and a 720m fine with 60fps most of the time and little to NO drops at all. When Legacy stopped being updated and they moved to the 'new and improved' version of rust I was sceptical but optimistic. Turns out the newer version of rust didn't run on my old reliable laptop and so I stopped playing for a few months until it was better optimized. Skip forward 3 4 months and it still didn't run above 30(ish) fps. I then played it again for a few days just to get a feel for the new version and when I found my lack of fps a struggle when fighting I opted to quit rust until I had a better computer. Skip another 2 3 months and I had just finished a custom computer with a gtx 770 i5 4690k and 16gb ram.Beauty I thought I'll be able to run rust easy with this and they'll have optimized it more in the time I've been gone!Wrong. Even my new computer struggled to run rust at a steady framerate. I tweaked the settings and barely managed to get my fps to hover around 60. Which was fine I put a fair few hours into rust during this period was active on mainly one server and actively waited for wipe day and updates like a kid on Christmas. But it seemed with every new feature implemented the devs drew further away from optimizing their game.And although there was always talk about performance increases and fixes in devblogs I never saw an immediate improvement in the game's performance a game that has been in early access for over 3 years and has seen no 'massive' improvements in optimization. Which is one of the core features that simply turns me off rust everytime I try to get back into it.Which is why I cannot recommend this game. EVen now with a GTX 1070 there is constant stuttering during gunfights massive lag spikes for no reason at all and random drops that make it nearly impossible to play this game sometimes. And I just cannot understand why they insist on adding paid cosmetics into a game that has barely had any massive performance enhances since it's change to the new version.I have not played rust for a long time and I doubt I will until some sort of progression is added and stability gets a major overhaul. Unfortunately that's just how it is with early access games but I look forward to playing rust when it is optimized and I feel the same excitement I felt during Legacy.,Rust,1,349,2595,491,1

Then you have to disconnect in order to hopefully rejoin and not get merc'd.I will say it is still enjoyable when you don't run into problems like that.Moments are intense and remind me of some of the clutch times I used to have in Counter Strike.I have yet to run into any cheaters in this game but I have started playing after this came out on Xbox One.Be thankful you don't have the Xbox One version.

1/10/2017,0,0,68,Recommended,I was hesitant to buy this based on some of the reviews I had read. I am glad that I made the purchase even though I am playing solo. It can be frustrating at first but if you find a decent server and perservere it can be quite enjoyable especially once you build a base/sleeping bag. There are a lot of griefers but there are quite a few helpful people as well from what I can gather. Rust certainly isn't going to be for everyone but it seems to accomplish it's goal quite well.I have never had some of the adrenaline rushes that I have experienced over the past 15 hours since I started playing this game. I can honestly say I have laughed out loud while I am running naked through the woods with nothing but a spear all the while being hunted by a veteran with an AK47.Do yourself a favor and gather wood/cloth as quickly as you can so you can make a base and a sleeping bag. Once you have the bag you respawn in your base and (hopefully) wont have to start from scratch as often.Good luck but stay the hell away from me ),Rust,3,68,1026,200,3

I logged 400 of the hours on a potato laptop so if you are worried about not running it you shouldn't be. I myself have played mostly private matches with a friend on PS4 (a nice addition although you can't have a cross platform party online) and Hoops. If you are on a horrible computer I do not recommend playing in standard or competitive since there are beefy maps such as Neo Tokyo Aquadome and Wasteland. I played Hoops most of the time which helped with aerials and it did not lag. Although I enjoyed playing Hoops and now have a new PC to play the other game modes I wish more people played Hoops and Hockey since they are sort of overlooked.

If you want a swordy fighty game you've got one.If you want to build a farm and lovingly tend your cactus plantation here you go.If you want to go on a crusade to free slaves and bring slavers to justice go do it.If you want to fight off hoardes of cannibals get to it.If you want to grow process and smuggle drugs for profit that's fine.If you want to form a band of ancient robots and take on the holy empire that's fine too.If you want to travel around looting rare and ancient artifacts from forgotten and crumbling ruins then there's plenty to do.If you want to acquire a pack of tame dogs and use them to hunt weirdly humanoid spider things? No problem.If you just want to explore a map that's the size of the Isle of Wight packed full of things to hunt fight grow eat kill explore buy sell and occasionally have a chat with in the midst of THE most beautiful and surprising videogame landscape I've ever seen in thirty years of gaming? This is your game.If I'd never bought it I can honestly say I would have missed out on years of the most enjoyable gaming of my life... and it isn't even fully released until a couple of weeks time.Get it and get it now.,Kenshi,5,1066,1310,248,5

6/15/2017,0,0,134,Not Recommended,"So I'll start off with a simple opening. GTA has been the element of ""Subversion"" sinces it consept. Addictive crime filled missions and mayham that was set around various time periods with varying fun and interesting charaters. But games only have so long of a play time and we of the PC world have a way to improve and even lengthen our playtime for games.That way? Mods. For as long as PC gaming has existed talented modders have poured years into modding games to expand their playtime. Everything from simple bug fixes all the way to damn near complete overhauls. Mods have become such a life blood for PC gaming that half the industry supports them. Valve (our overlords) even go out of their way to hire talented modders sometimes.Mods add a range of fun to the games and for a game that boasts its open world ""fun"" to do as you like you'd think they would be all for this. Rockstar even endorsed modding on several cases and yet here we stand in 2017. Rockstars parent company has choosen to blindside the community its game has built by starting with the big guns. Take two (T2) sent a C&amp D to the modding tools ""OpenIV"" which has been apart of our community for years now professionally ensuring mods of all kinds could be enjoyed and expand the playtime of many of the GTA games.One of the major selling points to being a PC game is the mods to the point even Consoles are starting to join in and this has effectively ended that for GTA. Will more tools spring up? Of course. But how many of those tools will go as far as OpenIV went to play by the very rules laid out by T2 and the law. How long until T2 shuts them down too?I'll be honest I wasn't much of a single player in this game. I loved the online play even with all its hack filled trash. The problem is though T2 decided to hit a legit modder not one making hacktools. I can google whose making the hacks right now easily if they're releasing them. But now like the promised single player DLC mods have been met with an axe for many players. So if you're here for the chance to mod the game and enjoy the singleplayer world while ignoring the online play? I have to say move on. Besthesda supports their community much better even with the insanity that is creation kit. Valve supports their community better so many other companies do as well. I'm sad to say it but move on to the greener games this company decided to suddenly pull support after years of endorsing it without warning.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,134,2461,457,1

5/24/2017,2,1,234,Not Recommended,When you first get the game you'll have a massive amount of fun for the first 1 2 times you play.And then you will realize how ed up it is and i'm not even talking about the performance issues that comes with EA games.This game was built on a mod from ArmA which makes it have fantastic potential of being a somewhat slower paced very tactical game that actually could make you THINK about what you're doing.Instead because the OoB circles close in at 500 miles per hour and within a couple minutes a pretty blue wall of you and death will force you to sprint out into a position or the open or even directly into the jaws of whoever was lucky enough to not get ed by whatever random demonic force that decides the circle positions.In its current state this game is a luck simulator it doesn't matter how smart you are how good you are how much strategy you use.If you end up outside or even on the edge of the first few circles you are ED. You WILL get killed by someone who was smiled upon by the luck gods who has a kar98 with an 8x sitting in a bush laughing at the poor s who were unlucky enough to have to sprint through open areas right into his sights.DONOTBUYTHISGAME(hopefully the devs will suddenly demonstrate that they have a brain or actually play their game and fix this)Just buy CoD if you want the same deathmatch that it is currently because at least CoD tries to do that.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,234,1390,263,1

That ontop of being able to form your own super houses and always having the suspense of losing everything is what kept me playing even after being raided multiple times and having to restart from scratch. The constant updates keeps me from getting slammed with the game all at once so that's just an added benefit.

6/19/2014,0,0,188,Recommended,Bought this game after being told to by friends. After all it's only $20. Now for $20 I just got one of the most fun gaming experiences I've had in a very long time. Teamed up with two friends and my brother and we went from being naked men running around dongs dangling from small rad to big rad. After the end of our first play session which was over eight hours we were the top dogs on our server. We had full kevlar gear and all the guns we could ever need and the research kits to make ammo. We would get into firefights all the time because people now came after us and it was so intense.I've had two days to play this game and I've already put over thirteen hours into it. That's more than I can say for almost all of my library. If you're thinking about picking this game up stop. Grab your wallet surrender your cash and satisfy GabeN and Garry Newman. Hell even if this game sits in your library forever without getting much play at least it was only $20. But I have a feeling it will see many hours of enjoyment.,Rust,4,188,1023,200,4

The fact that the PLAYERUNKNOWN ""lied"" (which is highly debatable because it is not likely that he mad the decision by himself) should NOT be relevant to an actual review of the GAME!So... get your collective heads out of your collective behinds stop whining about the trivial and quit the drama.The game is awesome and is going become more so every day.This is what counts.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,559,904,152,5

Pro's Pretty and highly polished fun cuteness and well designed perky interactions to make you feel positively reinforced (dings shiny new armor neat inventory system). Gorgeous environments. Had no crashes. Con's This game traps you in a metaphorical box. I have not even begun to scratch the surface of how grindy this must become later on but I'm already exhausted. Fights are not challenging just filler to extend time. They come in different pretty shapes (""Monsters"") but in the end it's all the same. I don't even have to need to kill a monster a second time the first kill of a new monster is already grindy and uninteresting to me. Also Story not good enough designed to be accessible and acquiesce a broad mass. I bought this on sale. Now I wish I hadn't spent that money. If the combat and gameplay loop makes you feel good this game may be epic for you. Again everything is very pretty and polished. My problems are with what happens behind the scenes so to speak the meta interaction between the player and the gameplay loop. Apparently this is a trope but I really thought This game is not respecting my time.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,29,1296,232,1

12/20/2014,0,0,421,Recommended,OK so here is what I think. The new graphics are great but the game still full of bugs the sounds are weird some times they crash and makes a annoying sound. The animals crash a lot like you are running trying to catch them and they stop then you start killing them and they reappear 100 meters ahead. I know the game is a alpha version yet so this things should be one of the things to improve. I'm not saying it's a bad game actually it is a awesome game but it still have a lot of bugs to correct. Good things? The new menu of building and hand made is very better then the last one the life hunger etc strips were in my opinion a great idea. The map is HUGE!! Keep the good work and the game will be one of the best games of survival. If you keep correcting bugs and keep improving the game it will be one of the few that will make front to the old MINECRAFT.,Rust,5,421,863,176,5

Psyonix s Rocket League the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars finds dumb fun in pulling turbocharge assisted front flips in an ice cream truck and the white knuckle strategy in working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense.

9/4/2018,0,0,1292,Recommended,Rust is kind of glitchy and has high pc requirements to run imo. Be careful about the people you trust because they can easily betray you or inside your clan and steal everything. Don't let random people join you... don't expect people to help either.The developers continue to add new content which was recently the cargo ship and hot air ballon. The cargo is buggy. The air balloon has some glitches. Other than that the point is that they add new things every 2 weeks or so with the updates. My advice is to find a server that you enjoy the most. Modded servers are easier to navigate as a new player because they give more loot faster and you can learn faster by progressing faster throughout the wipe.Don't forget to honey comb with triangles. Lock your boxes. Lock your doors. Spread your loot out. Build stable/sturdy houses. Enjoy the game. Don't get tilted and if you do take a break. ) The community is toxic on some servers and better on others. Every wipe is different. Find friends to play with. Of all the hours I've spent playing Rust I have only encountered one clan that has super obvious hackers (ESP). Other than that this game is amazing and the developers do a good job of adding new content. &lt 3 Highly recommend.,Rust,5,1292,1237,224,5

Its because I love the GTA franchise I love R* that I decided to give the game a bad review. Like a parent who reprimands their children when they did something wrong so must we the consumers do so when our beloved developer makes mistakes. I didn't reprimand them out of spite but it is out of love so that they will be able to rectify the errors in their ways. I will no longer be suporting (buying) your games until this issue is resolved and I believe a lot more people share the same sentiments as me. Red Dead Redemption 2 wont save you. It is up to you guys to redeem yourselves now.To all future buyers who is browsing through reviews in order to buy this game or not my advice is no dont buy it..at least not right now.

6/13/2015,0,0,391,Not Recommended,"Concerning the online cheaters are becoming more and more rampant in this game. The ""good"" ones deposit money into your account (which makes me come to the conclusion that Rockstar's shark cards are one of the worst ideas ever conceived if it's so easy to get money from hackers) and the bad ones can kill you randomly stay invincible be character models they shouldn't be take over your controls etc. The online only becomes completely safe if you either play solo or do a private match with friends but even then the backwards way they coded it means that when you go into a game it forces you into a public session before you can even join friends or whatnot. Is the game part fun? Yes. However getting free money when I want to work for it and thereby taking some of the fun out of it when just handed to me and the risk of coming across meaner hackers who will torment your experience is starting to get me turned off from this game.That and the fact that if you try to get a heist setup going people only wait about 10 seconds before they leave which means it can be hard to get one going unless it's a group of four friends.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,391,1131,214,1

5/28/2015,0,0,765,Recommended,Rust is a hardcore survival game with a heavy focus of player interaction and raiding. The game revolves around talking to people and forming different types of relationships whether good or bad. These relationships alter the way you play and can dictate whether you are peaceful to your neighbors or wild savages that become their worst nightmares.Everything in this game is nerve racking and tense regardless of how many hours you have under your belt. I find myself feeling the same emotions the same fear the same rush the same nerve racking tension that I felt when I first got the game and it doesn't get old. The game feels ruthless and the more you play the more you see your own ruthless tendencies.Other than blade or gun fights the game allows you to raid your enemies. Building a base is a must as you're going to need a place to stash your goods. At any point with enough materials you can attack a rival's base bombarding it with explosives. Raiding becomes a game of strategy in which the defender must use their base and its layout to take down any attackers or at least outsmart them and run them dry of firepower. Regardless of the results of a raid it's an intense feeling being part of one and the rush alone is worth it.Facepunch the developers of the game have shown an extreme dedication to the game. They push regular content updates harsher anti cheat and quality of life improvements. These arrive monthly and throughout the game's early access development have always given us a reason to keep playing.Lastly Rust isn't for everyone. It's a very harsh toxic and blood thirsty world full of savages ready to spear you down in an instant. If you can handle it Rust can offer small rays of hope in a dark desolate place. Small towns are sometimes formed trading posts bustle with industrial product and sometimes you meet people that stick it through the thick and thin with you.I highly recommend Rust for one reason alone. The bonds you create with others within the game aren't like those in any other. It's an experience you must try for yourself to understand. It's not easy to survive but when you do and you do it with others it becomes a whole different game.,Rust,5,765,2191,390,5

12/19/2016,0,0,43,Recommended,A trully excellent game. I'm loving it and it's still in alpha. It will give you the thrills of exploring and creating in a very well made platform. Everything i've seen so far has been spot on from the visuals the music and the co op posibillities.I hope System Era keeps it up can't wait for the full release.That said you can certainly enjoy the pre release version.,ASTRONEER,3,43,369,68,3
4/27/2018,0,0,1901,Not Recommended,To me this game is only fun because of multiplayer. I would never have put the hours I did into it if it were single player only and I may have played 10 hours of SP. So if you are looking for a SP review look elsewhere.I will summarize my review as to the update simply.If your average income per day includes a full heist and some missions which is a lot of playing you might break an average per day of 200k+. The combined assets of everything you can purchase with the new DLC probably reaches into the 500 600m mark and that's not including repairs insurance upgrades and consumables. 8m of in game cash costs $100 USD and even a decent car can cost you around 4 6m for instance.Add onto this that you can be banned permanently for doing nothing wrong and there are reports of this in the reviews and you can see how this is one of the grindiest games you can play.There needs to be a GTA Online that's expanded and made fair that isn't done by Rockstar (who censors their own name in game chat btw) because this is a lot of fun up until someone decides you shouldn't have it anymore.Original review (with thumbs up) This is one of the best games I've ever played which sucks because it's also one of the ing stupidest micro transaction systems ever. If Rockstar/Take Two make GTA6 and can somehow avoid the entire dumpster fire of Shark cards and make a fun game I'll be all over it but at the rate they're going based off of previous ban waves they're likely to blame the consumer and change nothing.Only saying yes because the game itself is very fun but everything else about it when it comes to buying things is terrible.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,1901,1631,306,1

You can't come in contact with a streamer in a game or you might get banned for ""stream sniping"" but I don't think anyone knows how much they do that. Also sometimes this game just has t physics for example you cant shoot through fence or wire fence which is extremely annoying because at least wooden fence breaks after a few shots but the wire fence does not. This game also has performance issues but that is expected from an Early access game just make sure you meet the recommended requirements and it should be enjoyable.

3/22/2017,0,0,226,Recommended,Grand Theft Auto V is a really good game that is FULL of surprises. The story mode is full of halarious suspenseful surprises. I enjoyed the campaign and the side missions as well. The online mode in GTA V is unique in its own ways. I really liked the heists in online mode. When in the freeroam part of online mode you may see a few modders but you can always join a new lobby if you want. The game looks pretty good graphics wise. I would definitely recommend this game for anyone who likes open world games.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,226,510,98,5

You can't start a haist because you need 4 ppl in your team but NOONE will join you or if they at least do they will only rush at enemies and die making you to lose. I want to say about one thing more. There is lot of glitches. I played only 21 hours but i saw people rolling and destroing cars with it like superman shops which u can't rob because your character will stuck in wall or neverending loading. I mean it it never ends because you are in game already but screen is blocked on loading stage. I am speaking about GTA online of course. Maybe single player is epic and full of adventures but for god's sake I bought GTA to play with people not to do some missions on solo. I did a lot of it in previous GTA games.

8/10/2017,0,0,207,Recommended,"Honestly this game is amazing. It has such a tactical gameplay feel and the gun selection is great.I have 93 hours played in H1Z1 and I can honestly say this game is more fun to play. I wouldn't say it's any better or worse because it's totally different. In H1Z1 you can run around with a shotgun. If you try that in this game you'll get sniped from someone on a mountain 200m away with an 8x scope.And if anyone tells you that a beastly PC is required they're wrong. I have an Intel Core i5 processor and a GTX 750 and I run all settings very low (with the exception of textures those are on medium) and it runs a steady 45 50 fps which is perfectly playable for me.The only complaint I have is the servers. It seems as if the devs weren't expecting this game to be as popular as it is and the servers are always overloaded. You sometimes get a popup saying ""network lag"" and you can't move at all. This only happens rarely and if it does it lasts 10 seconds at most. So in summation this game is great and you should pick it up if you don't have it already.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,207,1060,208,5

2/3/2016,1,1,59,Recommended,Euro Truck Simulator 2 is good as a simulator genre game. I'm not really into driving/racing games but this is fantastic. The feeling of driving around Europe just feels great. Most people aspire to go travelling I know this is far from reality but you still get a feeling like that. It's awesome.GAMEPLAYGameplay overall is good travelling across Europe and delivering cargos is fun but that's not the heart source for the fun. The fun comes in when you're driving normally. Remember the times when you would try to drive in GTA normally? Like you would do in real life? Well that's what this game is about. There is even a section in game where you can add your own music (on the radio) and play it whilst driving. That's not a big part of the game though I don't use it. The trucks feel like trucks you can definitley feel the weight being dragged on your back whilst driving past the 30 St Mary Axe also known as the Gherkin in London. There is a wide range of trucks to drive and after saving money by completing quick jobs you can eventually buy your own and drive freely. There is one bug which is constant throughout the game unfortunately the only way to fix it is by going directly into the game files and changing a couple settings. The bug is when there are no jobs to do. Of course there are but they are not showing up therefore you can't do anything. Like I said the gameplay is great but that bug is annoying and we should not be fixing it ourselves.7/10GRAPHICSThe graphics are poor. No matter what setting you have them on they are poor it does not mean this is a bad game and you shouldn't get it. Look at Club Penguin. That's not even 3D yet but Club Penguin is fantastic! There is nothing more to say really The textures for grass isn't 2D that says enough.4/10MULTIPLAYERThe multiplayer function is a mod which you have to download from a certain website. With roughly 2000 players on each server this is the best part about the game. I only play multiplayer because you can have a convoy with your friends and deliver your cargos together while passing the odd driver on his side in the middle of the road pleading for help. The admins run each server well and help keep it clean. There are rules though which you have to abide and if you break them you will get banned temporarily. In multiplayer everything is the same just without AI drivers around you. There are real people beside you and to be frankly honest some of them are s not to worry though press tab click on the person that is bothering you and report them they will soon be off your tail. 9/10OPTIMIZATIONThe game runs perfectly fine. I have a GTX970 and everything runs fine with no mind blowing graphics nothing should make you drop frames. The only time I drop frames is when there is around 30 to 40 people in one city on Multiplayer which might be a problem if you are in the same town and the same server with well known streamers such as Squirrel famously known for playing Simulator games.9/10OVERALLOverall game is brilliant it is worth the buy but not the 97% reviews. The only reason why I don't think it is worth the 97% is because of that bug that we have to fix ourselves. SCS should've fixed that a long time ago. I'm excited to play American Truck Simulator but I'm waiting for the Multiplayer Mod. The graphics are poor but if you judge the entirety of a games fun down to graphics then you are deluded (ง ل )ง and the optimization is fine. If you are looking to buy this game just keep an open mind as even I the reviewer was not into driving games but this takes it to another level for me.Thank you for readingI hope you enjoyed papa nicole,Euro Truck Simulator 2,3,59,3649,678,1

1/3/2019,0,0,142,Recommended,"The insurgency series are similar to squad and arma games but with the fluid movement and accessible mechanics of more arcade like shooters. But make no mistake insurgency is brutal. Headshots are a thing but they matter much less as 2 body shots will almost always take someone down the ""time to kill"" is very low for all weapons. It's hard to describe the brutality and unforgivingness of insurgency but it is easily understood when starting out. You will die. A lot. And hence you'll have to adapt your behaviour to a more realistic one you'll run from cover to cover stay away from doorways choose not to engage some enemies and stick with your teammates. If squad and arma are just a bit too slow for you but you enjoy the realism this game is for you. Sandstorm improves on its predecessors in visual quality spectacular sound and effects and adds an albeit at the moment rather limited customization system based on in game tokens that can only be earned in game (no bought). After a few hours you'll probably have an outfit of your choice for both teams it's no grind.

2/22/2016,1,1,176,Recommended,This is a fantastic game. I have 130+ hours and it's still just as fun as the first time I played it. The developers Psyonix add free new features constantly (new maps new game modes new toppers/flags) and cosmetic paid DLC such as the Batmobile. Plus Cross play ensures a huge playerbase at all hours of the day.However Psyonix seems to only consider the eSports scene and the high level players. They added three new non standard maps which is great but one is heavily focused on aerials (Underpass) and another is heavily focused on walls (Utopia Retro). Both of these are incredibly hard for new players to learn. Now it's fine to have these new maps as they are in their own game mode (Rocket Labs). However they did announce that they will consider putting these maps in the Competitive rotation. I've played games on these maps (Prospect III/Elite level not very high but not lowest of the low) where it was 0 0 the entire five minute game and 2 3 minutes of overtime.This game is awesome.

It induces rage I want a causal game not one that constintly is only ranked Killer will leave loby if you enter with 3 or more friends I am not good at technical game plays like fliching and stuff which you need to be good at to play game. (I personally hate learning that stuff since it breaks the game a little and just want to not invest that much time.) No balance. Even a rank 1 surv can get absolutely destroyed by a rank 15 killer. Sure you'll waste 3 minutes but thats about it. Depending on team not very much. Cheaters on crackLong Okay so palets get glitched (on top of several more game breaking ones killers are always way more in favor then survivors. They give you one map in the game thats good for a survivor and it gets nerfed. Your team mates usually get you killed. If your a killer main then the only choice is trapper there is only one killer TRAPPER he moves so fast with the chase buff that he sprints past you. Only thing that could counter him was sprint burst/lethe you can't use them together now cause of nerf. If you want a game you could casually enjoy this is NOT it. You shouldn't even play surv cause you barely ever are enjoying urself with all the bs. A killer can flick the mouse and 360 around buildings cars and trees big obsticals as well that shouldn't be able to reach. I get this is a skill thing but to be honest whats the point in trees and cars and T walls? You can take em out. I think flicking should be out. It makes more sense in the game that way. Also you should take out being able to hit through windows. I get hit through walls when that happens. I will be around a coner and his hand will hit me through a wall. How can the trapper even hit someone (Same for nurse wraith and every other killer but myers) with a weapon that big. You can't ever juke a billy hit cause range is so long and u can 360 hit the WHOLE area around you.,Dead by Daylight,1,222,2194,433,1

Don't even get me started on the character customization because there is very little and there is no progression throughout the game if they did something similar with fortnite with the levels and challenges players would have a reason to play the game and would have a better time playing it.... BUT! instead of that you aimlessly run around getting one shotted with level 3 armour and level 2 helmet with a shotgun 10m way.

I still enjoy the game but be aware ""If you're so mad that you lost all your stuff then maybe you should get your 20$ back"" Is a common saying used by the thick skulled ruffian raiders of many of the servers.

However you always improve patch by patch and I like that.The game himself is full of nice innovations and fun times are more and more usual I would like that you guys adapt at the maximum as you can the playability for lower performances systems I know that you know some people can't have a good experience because of their FPS I personnaly think it's the issue that's killing your game actually.I used to play with my linux OS and my experience on it was totally empty because the game didn't even lauch so for this game for a big part I changed my OS to get a Win7 one.

6/29/2016,0,0,2723,Recommended,This is a game I can not recommend highly enough but also one I apprehensively recommend to other PC gamers and only after I've known them for a while. The GTA brand is one that is known for controversy and most people have a preconceived notion about the franchise. I know I did.I played a few of the games in the GTA series (read HOT COFFEE) ) and never got it . That was until GTA V and the Heist update. It is the most fun I've had in a 4 player game (the most you can heist with) ever! Initially it was just fun to take off my white hat and stop playing the role of the good guy. But after carefully planning bank robberies with friends knocking over armored cars and breaking criminals out of prison I was fully embracing my dark side and the hedonistic joy that is GTA V. I have since amassed a small criminal empire... In the game of course. )It does have one significant drawback. HACKERS. Rockstar (RS) does try to keep them from ruining the game but they are seemingly one step ahead. With each patch RS plugs some of holes the hackers exploit but some remain and most pop back up after the hackers learn their way around the new patch.Online hackers are the only thing keeping this from being a perfect game.One thing to be aware of is the lack of controller options. It works great with most gamepads but you will need a second party program to get steering wheels and some other controlers working in the game. I have a Thrustmaster steering wheel and have to use X360ce to get GTA V to see my steering wheel. In between play sessions I often think about my crews next adventure in Los Santos. There are so many areas to explore I don't think one person can see it all. The map is approximately 100 square miles (13x7) with Los Santos being about 21 square miles The game is a technological marvel with top notch graphics and game play. I have over 1 000 hours in Los Santos and gladly no end in sight. It's a great return on a game investment.It's an absolute no brainer. If it's on sale get it! ),Grand Theft Auto V,5,2723,2012,383,5

The game is very fast there's a lot of skill involved but the controls are simple and it's easy to play more Mario Kart than a ""proper"" car sim.There are a few different cars in the game with others available as unlocks and DLC. I found the single player game a bit repetitive. There's not a proper campaign which doesn't help. The graphics and sound are good.It's funny watching a car race the length of the pitch in order to put the ball in from the goal line only to miss and go crashing into the back of the net. This happens very frequently.I think I would probably enjoy this multiplayer but none of my friends own it. This is possibly because I'm a sad sack no mates.",Rocket League®,3,1,733,140,3

You are instantly killed and prevented from getting a foothold by long established clans in the game even on low population servers. There's no player friendly starting area where you can learn the basics of the game you just killed and corpse looted on sight.

12/12/2016,0,0,74,Not Recommended,"This game used to be good. I loved it it made me feel in a game that I haven't in a long time and that's fear and paranoia. However when they released a brand new version with a new map graphics and items I just didn't enjoy it as much as I used to. At leased it gave you the option to go back to the original ""Legacy"" version. Then after a few years removed the Legacy version.I loved the Legacy version and it did many things better than the new version we have now. Me and many other people would agree. Sure it had some bugs and opimization issues but it was in alpha at the time. It was also simple but not too simple plus it had a haunting atmosphere that gives me chills to this day. Plus at the time a massively muliplayer survival game was new. Rust was made in the survival game craze when survival games were first coming to light. Being masively multiplayer gave Rust a certain feel of fear and paranoia that other games just could not replicate. The new version removes that atmosphere and just doesn't pack that punch.To be honest I never thought this game would be that sucessful legacy or no this game has flaws that drive people away. The fan base is also very toxic and the game could easily be classified as 'silly'.

8/27/2017,0,0,525,Recommended,What can be said about Rocket league that has not already been said?First i would like to say that i am not a huge fan of e sport style games. Games Like DOTA CS GO and LOL are not really a great game to just go out and play the communities and players can be rather toxic and annoying when even playing casual games (overwatch goes without saying). However with rocket league an average gamer can pick up the game and actually have a good time playing with almost anyone while there are toxic members in ever facet of every game this one seems to be more easy to deal with and have less heads to worry about. While im all for some good jabs at opponents as most people can probably contest some people are just unbearable. (if i had a dollar for ever jack wad that told me to kys i could pay a few months rent in advance)The platform is spot on and it goes without saying that the game has become rather polished over the years leaving a clean and fun competitive environment to flex ones skills and improve.DLC is all cosmetic and some of the money they get form sales goes towards having more tournaments with larger cash pools. so its really refreshing to see this as opposed to PTW style DLC.If you game with a lot of friends i recommend this game it's fun and can really lead to some epic high energy matches. There is a learning curve to get over as far as getting better at the game and being able to preform high skilled maneuvers. But overall most of these skills are not impossible to lean and eventually become more proficient at.Finally i will say this if you do not like games that require time and patients to learn and possibly even master this or many other e sport titles may not be your cup of tea. But if you like physically grinding to become better and like rich competitive environments then rocket league is a solid buy.,Rocket League®,5,525,1844,347,5

1/16/2018,0,0,214,Not Recommended,"I've spent some time in this game and have come to the conclusion that there are some major fundemental problems with this game. But before I get to that here are the pros The game experience is intense and there is no other game that I can think of that makes my blood flowing as much. There can be geniune moments of fear panic heartbreak but there are other moments of sheer excitement shouting and cheering. The gameplay is unique and there are many different strategies one can emply whilst scavenging around the two massive maps. Team play offers more dynamic gameplay but Solo is just as fun.Now to the Cons Guns are sluggish and it feels like you have to wrestle them down just to control the recoil. You can spend an entire clip on someone at medium range without hitting them once. The game is about as buggy as can be. There isn't one aspect about this game that feels refined or polished. Hackers everywhere. Due to the randomness of the circles there are some instances where skill is taken out of the equation and you're forced to hope for good luck. Community is Toxic as hell. Often times death feels unfair or cheap. I'm not talking about being salty over being killed by a camper either. I'm talking about how close range firing seems to be a complete 50/50 since weapons lose all but some of their accuracy after the first shot. No region locking.I want to love this game. I've played so much of it hoping that at some point I'll see some sort of end to the equation and be able to work with the game and all its flaws. But it becomes difficult when it seems to actively work against you at every corner. I've stopped having fun with it now I've become more experienced in it. Now every time the match ends even if I win doesn't seem to be worth all the anger and frustration that you have to put up with in order to get there. All this added on to the fact that there is a hacker about every two games leaves a sour taste in my mouth.That and it's just insulting that they've added payed loot crates a system which is already seen as cancerous to a game that in its ""released"" state feels like a Beta.I would not reccomend this game to anyone but the most hardcore of players.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,214,2196,411,1

And nonetheless you will make mistakes or just dont know the right action to bump the ball out of the danger zone.And here beginns the problem with Rocket League &gt its ing toxic in the competitive games through all leagues when you make a mistake or something is against the believing of a other.There is a steady flow of insults threats and other really unwelcoming things. There are rarely players who stepp in against this written abuse of others not to think about that RL would do something against. The best thing would to be to block all non standardised communication. Sadly there are also rarely player who enjoy the competition and appreciate the fun factor behind no you have to verbally smash your enemies or teammates.Competitive is a mode which should be fun but sometimes its unbearabe and therefore is a huge part of the game ""bad"" so no recommendation for the whole game.

9/9/2015,0,0,29,Recommended,EDIT They appear to have fixed the problem I was complaining about. As of January 1 2016 the online gameplay was fluid and smooth. Truly an enjoyable experience. This is one of (if not the) best competitive automobile soccer games on the market (a huge library to be sure.)The single player experience unfortunately is the same as below but with the improved servers who wants to play single player?Do NOT buy this game until they fix the servers. The lag makes this game unplayable online. Everyone rubberbands all over the court. I had a game where the ball just appeared in our net.If you decide to play this game offline with ai teammates you should also be prepared for disappointment. On rookie difficulty a toddler could destroy the ai 10 0. One step up to pro and it seems like you are playing against 7 players when it is truly 4 v4.I had a season where I lost 4 games 0 1. all 4 goals were scored by my ai teammates (out of 9 games.)I cannot believe a certain angry gamer gave this solid 4 game a 9 out of 10 with a badass seal of approval.,Rocket League®,3,29,1050,197,3

4/13/2017,0,0,220,Not Recommended,Rewriting the review as there's still major flaws with the game that prevent it from being worthwhile playing. Weapon Issues Every fight full auto jams after a few rounds and you have to take your finger off the mouse to reset (lag or glitching idk happens on other modes too). Impossible to gauge half of my sniper shots over 500m as terrain texture and depth doesn't vary same goes for foliage rock and tree cover. The fact that you can't seperate lean + ADS from changing your weapon hand in third person gets you killed and drives you batshit too. Bullet loops for your stock would serve a much better role of being a tactical reloading mod for sohtgun and bolt action rifles chambering single cartridges at a time.Community Issues My experience with the community is they fit into 3 main categories Casual gamers who don't know how to reload their gun somewhat experienced juvenile delinquents of millenial or H1Z1/ArmaModded/CoD backgrounds and absolute monsters from the Rust/GenXCoD/ArmaSquad/Squad/TacticalShooter crowd. It can drive someone to smash their monitor (whoops P) when they're constantly put with the latter types and vice versa please consider a skill based ranking system for everyone's sake Bluemoon. Regardless of category please don't make the community worse by exiting to lobby during flight turn off your mic or lone wolfing it like a (on that note please change chance base solo/semi squad queing in duos and squads to a checklist option deactivated by default).Overall game issues There is no overall purpose to the game from the onset the premise is so casual and yet the gameplay is so serious and replayable. Community market items aren't valuable (outside of the imfamous and pointless preorder) due to their rarity so your time is wasted on that front. I wish there was a way in game to search for discord communities and individuals when you wanna play seriously or for competitive tornament play with a way to register a persistent clan and their respective squads for match making. So the gameplay mechanics are remarkably versatile yet the mods being developed for custom servers are remarkably facepalm. Adding full ruleset and asset modding would be a massive benefit to your modding community. Finally please consider a Virtual Reality standalone launcher or custom modded option for those that want an Onward style battle royale experience. I've uninstalled for now as I can't be bothered with the existing issues but i'll keep an eye on your progress.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,220,2496,413,1

10/14/2017,0,0,204,Not Recommended,"At the point of writing this review I have 134.6 hours logged in the game. The game has some glaring issues that massively detract from the overall fun factor of the game.First and foremost I believe the survivors should have invulnerability frames when jumping over a palet or through a window. It defeats the purpose of trying to escape using them if you're locked in the animation as the survivor but the killer can still hit you. Furthermore YOU CAN STILL BE HIT BY THE KILLER EVEN WHEN YOU FULLY MAKE IT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF A PALLET OR WINDOW!!! THIS IS INFURIATING!!! Before people question my internet or my computer my internet is fast my computer is a top tier gaming rig and my monitor outputs the game at 144hz. It's not my setup. It's the game and I call t.Leatherface swings his chainsaw seven times after being charged. SEVEN TIMES!!! This makes it next to impossible to dodge because it's an instant one shot down if he even hits you once and he gets seven chances. The odds are extremely in his favor. He also runs extremely fast so he pretty much makes the hillbilly obsolete in pretty much every way except the hillbilly can use his chainsaw charging move to get across the map faster. The hillbilly is properly balanced because even though his chainsaw move is a one shot down he only swings it once and he's can't move much left and right while running so he's challenging to control when he's running. Leatherface is a good killer but he needs to be balanced. Instead of seven swings maybe four. Also maybe make him run a bit slower.The Doctor is extremely annoying to play against to the point that it is literally no fun. The Doctor's electrical area effect move makes it impossible to hide if you are near him. Every player playing the Doctor that I've played against just spams this move every couple seconds. Eventually it hits someone then they just chase them down and inevitably hook them. Then when survivors try to go for the hooked player the Doctor is still spamming the electrical move and finds where people are before they can even get close enough to help. Also just being near him even if he isn't doing his electrical move starts charging your sanity meter eventually making you go insane. Once you reach level three you start seeing things and screaming which gives away your position. You can take a minute and ""snap out of it "" but you don't actually snap out of it. You only go back down to level two. So you're not screaming but you're still at a major disadvantage because again your sanity meter charges from just being in general proximity with the Doctor. EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING and not fun.If you are playing with friends as survivors and you can't connect to the host the game should dump you back to the lobby you and your friends started in not all the way back to menu. This game has been out for a long time now that's just poor development plain and simple.Lastly I feel that the killer perk ""IRON GRASP"" detracts from the spirit of the game. As a survivor it's already hard enough escape the killers as most of them run WAY FASTER. Then you have to fill up the struggle meter on top of that for a small chance of being able to hop off the killers shoulder. When you get downed and you're getting picked up there's a slight hope you could still escape and maybe depending on where on the map you get picked up you might be far enough away from a hook to struggle free before the killer reaches one. Adding iron grasp makes this literally impossible because no matter how far away from any hook you may be you are NEVER getting that struggle meter full. You would be lucky to even get it halfway. So whenever me and my friends realize that the killer has iron grasp we don't even bother trying to struggle because it's pointless.There are also elements of the map that look like you can go through but you can't. You're running from the killer you see a body sized split between a rock and a tree so you go for it. Nope you get stuck because that body sized split is actually a wall with an invisible texture on it to make it look like your could go through but you can't. This led to some unfair deaths but as I've learned to spot these areas and run around them these unfair deaths happen a lot less. This is poor design imo.I've had a lot of fun with this game but at this point those flaws are drastically weighing down the longevity of the game to the point where I don't see myself playing much longer unless these issues are resolved.",Dead by Daylight,1,204,4495,828,1

11/2/2015,0,0,221,Not Recommended,2018 REVIEW Total cash grab garbage with no anti cheat. So you can lose that progress what a terrible form this game has taken. Not going to mention the positive things due to the company's hate for it's consumers despite making more money than it ever has in the past year 4 years.Good things aside this is microtransaction garbage Take Two went hard after modders and back pedaled after everyone got angry. Not a fan of the Publisher or the Studio at this point anymore.Update 4/23 Trying to enter the online and play is just a relization the last few patches have been massive grinds to get players to purchase SHARK card currency which is just anti consumer grinding garbage. Last year was the biggest growth year of TAKE TWO Interactive's finacial sector in the past 4 years despite the game being out for 4 years. The game is garbage the networking security is terrible. You can easily gather information on other players and attack their internet connections using free networking security tools.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,221,1003,173,1

6/15/2017,0,0,231,Not Recommended,"The GoodSingle player is great. Good story telling along with memorable characters and a triple arch adds a new refreshing take on what was predominantly dominated by 40 hour gameplay told by one character.The BadMultiplayer. Everything about it. Take Two's most recent stance on removing support for a widely used modding tool is just their newest tactic on their anti consumer checklist. Releasing new ""expansions"" and reskinning them without adding any meaningful content to the experience. By making the majority of new additions to gameplay (i.e. Bikers CEO gun running etc.) so expensive that it totaly alienates the casual player by forcing them into a never ending cycle of micro transactions. Instancing issues along with common connectivity problems since launch day make even just joining a friends lobby an absolute nuisance.TLDR Grab for the single player if its on sale.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,231,884,140,1

11/24/2018,0,0,845,Recommended,"It's not hard to say why this game is fantastic! You as a player can choose to be either a killer or a survivior. A killers job is to stop the survivors from escaping and vice versa as a survivor. The limited ammount of tools as a survivor makes it difficult to survive as most of the maps you can play on have a 30%ish rate of excape. If you play for a while there is a learning curve plus the bloodweb that you can grind through and as you unlock more abilitys you feel so much stronger. I am 830 hours into this game and I still love every second of it ""Almost"" The only thing I'm not a huge fan of is 4 man groups of survivors as the in game was designed to have a lack of communication to make you feel... More helpless. The jumpscares the variety of killers and maps and the tension does dull out after a few hundred hours of gameplay but none the less it is a fantastic buy If they droped the whole game right now for 60 with all dlc youd be getting a steal.",Dead by Daylight,5,845,965,195,5

7/25/2016,2,2,47,Not Recommended,Okay im gonna dive right into it. Rust is a good game. The concept is amazing and the mechanics are pretty well done. But i would not recommened this game to anyone with a life. i.e Job Girlfriend or any type of activity that you do that does not take place in your computer chair. Rust is ruined by its god awful community which is by far the worst i have ever EVER witnessed. I'll explain why.The people who play this game are just disgusting and no im not saying this because i juts got raided or died i'm saying this because they are just genuine no life s. If you're a naked with a rock just trying to mine a tree to even take 1 step in the first part of the game you will get shot dead by a level 30 Veteran armed to the teeth full armor AK47 the whole nine yards. It's not even fun i promise you. When you join a server your are always gonna be behind everyone which makes it impossible to even do anything. Noobies are literally dominated by any person with a gun and it will always stay that way. No matter how many times you start over from getting shot on sight you will keep dying and keep losing everything. Hours of resources gone soon as you go offline to go to work sleep or hell even take a i promise you will come back to find everything you have gone. Now i have been raided AND done the raiding and honestly out of the 40 or so hours ive played this game i'd say 3 are doing something actually fun like raiding firefights over air drops etc. But the remaining 27 hours are literally me farming resources getting shot dead. Trying to find food getting shot dead. Aimlessly making some sort of house to protect my 1 stone...... Theeen coming back to find it stolen house broken a sign saying i'm gay... Oh yeah that's right! Shot dead. I promise you people do not play this game with out at least 3 friends becuase if you don't every hour of this game you play it will just be you hitting trees dying hitting rocks dying running around naked getting sprayed down. The game itself has the potential to be very very fun but due to no life kos'ers you will have payed $20 to hit trees get shot while your naked and get robbed everytime you go offline. The new xp system ruins it too but only minorly so i'm gonna go fast to get it over with. IttakeswaytoolongtogetenenoughtXPforanythingusefulorprotectivebutbythetimeyoufinallygetsaidXPyouwillhavegottenraided50thousandtimesandhavedied150milliontimessointheendyou'realwaysatsquare1. Oh and if you usually cant get past square 1 because why? A. B. or C?A. Shot deadB. Shot deadC. Shot dead....because that level 30 kos'er REALLY AND I MEAN REALLY NEEDED YOUR ROCK AND TORCH.So to wrap it up terrible community probably the worst i've ever seen and you pay 20 buckeroonies to get a peice of wood build a shack go off for couple hours to have a life then come back annnnnnnnnnnnnnndddd You already know this one ) No? I'll give you a hint..Shot dead.Please please people dont pay money to die every 10 mins to neckbeards that play this game all day. The life you have so far more worth it.

7/14/2015,0,0,202,Recommended,Love this game. The ranked system could use alot of love thou. Now why do I love this game but I cannot recommend it to put it simply it is because the game will probably have a very shot lifecycle and there isnt alot to do outside of multiplayer. Unless the devs insitute and ranking system or better leaderboards my $20 bucks will shrivel up and die (starcraft 2 dota league of legends all of these games have a very repitive multiplayer and not much else to do similiar to Rocket League the reason people keep coming back is to advance in rank). In its current state I dont see the game being very popular for more then a couple months. After that it will be one of thoes games that is fun with friends. I also feel that $19.99 is to much for the game. I would recommend for $10.00 even $15.00 the gameplay is fun but I think it is overpriced. I pray the devs add more to the ranking system. Being able to create a team/guild/whatever you want to call it and bring it online into the ranking system is exactly what this game needs. Solid game just not to much to it for $20,Rocket League®,5,202,1076,208,5

11/11/2017,0,0,557,Recommended,Approaching 400 hours and may I say it's been a long journey. From being the first of my friends to recieve the game to now having 6 close friends playing it has been wonderful. If you want to read reviews on how bad the game is scroll elsewhere. Instead of going on about all the bad things about the game I'll tell you about the development and skills of myself and my fellow cohorts. 1. (Myself) aka Skewer The first player out of this group of friends to play the game. Skilled enough in battle. He's grown up to be a fierce warrior. Born from the fires of FPS games. Not the best FPS player but it is his preffered gametype and he excels at most of them. Some might say if he had to choose between Beginner Intermediate Advanced or Hardcore difficulty. He would pick Advanced. Hardcore is for wussies. 2. (Lewi) aka Moneyman aka CuriousMoney He didn't jump into the PC race until last year but he's made a big footprint in the world of PC gaming in the past few months. Some might call him a Rocket League connoiseur but this man can adapt to any playing field if he enjoys the game. Put him in an FPS he gets good at it. Put him in a Strategy game he gets good at it. Hell if you put him in a farming simulator he could somehow do what you do and do it 100 times better. That's just who he is. Not only is he lethal but he has your back 100%. An asset... No! A necessity to the PUBG squadron. 3. (Josh) aka Joshy A skilled warrior in the art of FPS combat. This man carries the background of over 700 hours in Counter Strike and an accompanying 700 hours in Rocket League. He has the reflexes and accuracy of a highly trained sniper. Even though he only has 53 hours in PUBG he is a force to reckon with. Don't let a few beers get to this guy. After he knocks a few finely chosen brewskis down his accuracy goes from 100% to 1000%. Devastating on the playing field and always has your six. 4. (David) aka Flamennight aka Nice Ugly Boy The Dark Souls addict. Almost 500 hours in Dork Souls. He has mastered the art of the sword but what happens when you put a rifle in his hands? Where do we start with him? This guy has always been one to jump into FPS games with me. If I buy a game and I like it this Ugly Boy is down to join me. Quite adaptable to any game really. I wouldn't say FPS games are his #1 but he's got skills. I've had some delicious chicken dinners with this one. Nice boy. Nice ugly boy.5. (Adam) aka AdamWest aka Big G aka Caboose This guy... This guy... This mofo will teamkill you with a grenade and not even blink. He says he's sorry but we all know he doesn't mean it. This dude has 1 700 flippin hours in Total war games! Like who does that?! Anyways... He is not a bad FPS player. Hey I didn't say he was good. Just kidding Big G. He's good at FPS games. In PUBG you need to be a good strategist and G just needs to figure that part out. Don't leave it to him to call the shots. I personally think he has a lot of potential in PUBG. He just has to reach the breaking point. You'll get there someday buddy. Oh and he ALWAYS is the last to leave a location and takes forever to search a building. 6. (Colton) aka The Postman This dude can be a little stubborn. It took him long enough to buy PUBG but he finally did and he really enjoys it. The Postman has a very large palette for video games. He has many hours in the Fallout series but also quite a bit in Garry's Mod Just Cause and Unturned. It's fun to have him in the squad because he enjoys the game no matter what. I'm sitting here getting frustrated when we lose and he finds the fun in it all. Not my first choice to have my back in PUBG but he can get kills when you need him and can get you a laugh at any moment in time. Skilled and fun what else can you ask for? 7. (Dylan) aka Cowbell aka Groot Oh Dylan. Poor poor Dylan. Even though you always get dragged into our silly games you find a way to have a laugh and enjoy yourself. I still don't know if he has a kill yet in PUBG but he only has 27 hours in game so it's alright. Let me tell you something. He is an awesome looter. He is also very appreciative of the vehicles in the game. I have witnessed an amazing thing from him. After three vehicles zoomed past me in game they headed straight for G Ugly Boy and the marvelous Groot. I watched as Groot took on a speeding buggy backwards. He looked away from his attackers. They didn't deserve his final stare. He looked away at death and laughed. It slammed into him... and knocked him down but he took it like a man. Respect for this guy. He'll follow you into to battle and even though he might be the first to die. He died for you.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,557,4630,919,5

12/13/2013,0,0,12,Recommended,So playing the game for about an hour and a half I've come to write a review.Now the sole reason I purchased this game was to play with friends in the sort that'd we be able to travel together and do whatever we wanted. This is however not the case.Let's start with the positive aspects (I do realize this game is in Alpha this is for the game at its current state 12/13/13)So joined into the server US Central 3 along with 2 other friends. We expected to be able to group up and start to tackle this game together. My wishes did not come true. You are spawned very spaciously across the map. Some might take this at a positive and some a negative. I found this a drawback in the case that at the games current state it has no minimap or compass to show you where you're headed. Unless you've been playing this game for a long time and can figure out all the landscapes and where to tell your friends to go you wont be grouping up for a LONG time. For the 2 hours I played this game we were unable to find eachother for the entire time. I found this a bit dissapointing as most of the time I was traveling and being beaten to death by another newbie with a rock. This is also another reason I found the start to be very annoying. Everyone is out to kill you you're lucky if you find someone who wont kill you and in the end they probably will end up smashing your head in. I have read that you can follow and try to meet up right under the sun or moon but after attempting this for awhile I found it to be no use because we still could not find eachother. I would say my last issue is the server lag. But I still need to hand it to this game. It's in Alpha and a damn good alpha. Being a huge Garry's mod fan I know the features and content coming out in the future will greatly improve this game. I still recommend the game because I know it will be perfection when it's finished.,Rust,3,12,1881,373,3

Definitely not recommended for casuals but if you enjoy both building bases and shooting and have a lot of time on your hands there is nothing better out there. Optimization is not the best but the devs are extremely active and push out updates every single week. A lot of people have been writing bad reviews just to spite the developers and try to get the game developed to cater to them because they got used to having end game content on the first day of a cycle but primitive fighting is quite fun also and the end game content was always intended to take a bit to reach.

8/10/2018,0,0,132,Recommended,"I have played Monster Hunter since 2013 with 350 hours in MH4U and 60 hours in MHG and MHW for me is a really big mixed bag. There is one BIG Minus that literally almost made me not recommend this game but if you have enough patience to get through the big minus then you should definately get this game.POSITIVES+The co op (When it works) is friggin amazing the gameplay of MHW is the best I have ever seen especially ranged weapons now. Capcom learned from Dragons Dohma with the feel of the bow and mounting and it feels amazing.+Watching monsters fight each other in the wild is the greatest thing I have ever seen the trailer doesn't give justice to the ""oh quot moment when you see a monster pick up another monster and slam him into the ground.NEGATIVES (The BIG minus) As someone who primarily plays Monster Hunter games for the multiplayer co op I have to ask Capcom why do you have to try and meld the singleplayer and multiplayer campaign together? There would be no trouble if you were able to play story missions together from the beginning but you have to launch and then quit after you've finished the cutscene just to relaunch the mission if you want to play with friends. &lt sidenote&gt Capcom should be able to at least know how to put multiple people in the cutscene or instead just show the one player in the cutscene when you're in the party together. Capcom should know this because they literally have monster intro cutscenes in previous games like MH4U granted it isn't as cinematic as MHW but they could have at least done something like that just so it could stop the frustration with the players. The relaunching wouldn't be a problem because you can join one of your friends in the middle of the battle if you want but there is one big problem with the connections itself. I don't know if it is just me but me and my friends literally a few states away sometimes cannot even join each other's session or even mid join the mission. Most of the time whenever we try to midjoin the mission after the friend watched the cutscene a pop up shows up saying it failed to join the quest. I know MH is usually peer to peer but it has never been this bad and I hope Capcom fixes this issue. Expeditions they're just gathering quests but it is so hard to go on a multiplayer expedition.I still haven't made it past HR 8 so these are my earliest impressions and my biggest problems and I do hope that Capcom fixes the servers if there is anything to fix otherwise I hope there's something we can do to make the connection better for most people.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,4,132,2561,473,4

The game is completely changed I used to know everything there was to know about the game and now it's gotten to where I have no idea what the hell I'm doing. They changed it so much that it's not even the game it used to be any more. I would've rather they kept the game it used to be then pumping out updates. It's not the same game anymore in any way.,Rust,1,98,576,124,1

6/24/2017,0,0,37,Recommended,Here i was thinking this was just another FPS multiplayer until i actually played it. I was drawn off of multiplayer shooters like CSGO and similar online games because of the community and how competitive it got. I just wanted to have a fun experience and this game is bringing me back. Whats good about it is that the players dont have a rank system and you start off with nothing but your fists. You are first seen in a crashing jet and when it jets over the island it will give you time to choose where you start by jumping out of the plane. the only problem with this is that people leave at the same time and there could be like 20 people in the same area making it a hunger games simulator and you would just die as soon as u landed.The game itself is bugged but thats to be expected from an early acc. game. I also dont like how quickly they shrink the map. if you are too far away because say if you wanted to start at the edge of the map. you only got a few minutes to sprint towards where the border will be. i know thats to prevent players from doing nothing but its too short i feel. i have experianced lag spikes mid game dropping to zero frames and getting killed. Its fixable tho. im not picky or about it.I do wish for there to be a kill cam or something. when im checking corners in what i think is a empty town. bam im dead. I dont know where it came from and would like to know.Finding guns and equipment is a good concept and if they add a strict anti cheat policy and keep polishing the game and keep adding cool stuff. It has alot of potential. Overall Go for it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,37,1586,313,1

6/14/2016,0,0,6,Recommended,Earliest impression This game is very fun and enjoyable for an asymmetrical game moreso for a horror game.As one of the four survivors it is an absolutely heart pounding experience trying to escape from each playground a killer gets to roam in while wither working together as a team or alone trying to do whatever you can.As one of the three killers it is a fun game of cat and mouse to try your best to hunt down injure and sacrifice the survivors.For now it does seem very light in content but it does show a good deal of promise for the future. Definitely recommend it though.(Will update after more playtime),Dead by Daylight,3,6,613,111,3

5/8/2017,0,0,160,Recommended,This game is a lot of fun and addicting to play there are a few drawbacks tho. i have noticed that some of my friends have a constant problem with crashes in the pre game lobby this may be due to the fact of all the guns and such creating lag which some pc's may not be able to handle i recommend if you have this issue as well to run to the water as soon as you enter the pregame lobby this seems to help the issue. the other big downfall to this game is the memory leak... i find myself constantly having to restart the game after a few rounds some times after every round i must restart. other than those 2 cons this game is amazing with too many positive features to list. if you are looking for a better version of H1Z1 or a new shooter survival game i highly recommend. and the non pay 2 win unlike h1z1 is amazing. i highly recommend this game to all!,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,160,858,172,4
11/23/2017,0,0,214,Recommended,Do you like Cars? Do you wanna play Soccer without actually going outside? Do mind microtransactions? (No but I do want a mystery decal!) (Too Bad..) Well then Rocket League is a game that needs to be in your library. With different mini games it keeps you entertained while there are events that get you some cool items every so often. Try to climb the rankings in competitive games or just play casual with your friends. (Just make sure not to get scored on when you're the goalie of the team expect to get yelled at...) Customize your car with awesome looking items....exept here comes the negative side of the review. You can customize your car but if you want good looking items you have to get them in crates which cost real life money. To top that off even if you do buy crates you have a really low chance of getting a mystery decal. (Best looking decals.) But remember it only changes the look of your car so unless you're a dedicated player don't bother with the crates. So besides the microtransaction part this is a really good game and I highly recommend it. It's just an all out fun thing to play I give it a 7/10.,Rocket League®,5,214,1128,210,5

8/6/2016,0,0,40,Not Recommended,I will start off by saying that this is a fun game you play as a killer hit survivors to down them then hang their bodies on hooks to sacrifice them or play as a survivor and work on generators to get an exit open to escape while avoiding the killer but that fun is soon sapped out of the game when you run into these flaws.1. Continual window hopping survivors. Now to be fair they have tried to address this issue but it's still an issue every map has at least 1 spot that survivors can run around in an infinite circles and it becomes a game of who's going to mess up first. Only problem is you wil get survivors who will not mess up and now you have to give up and go check generators or if all generators are done you have to wait for them to make a run for the exit. Which could be in 10 minutes or 30 minutes how ever long they feel like or until they mess up. 2. TERRIBLE MATCHMAKING. As a survivor or killer I was constantly matched against killers/survivors who were 20 30 even as high as 40 levels higher then me. Now for those of you who don't own this game what this means is im running around against a killer or multiple survivors who have high level perks which will buff them and assist them in some wayand they have multiple of these perks dues to their high level while you have 1 perk available and its a low level common perk. So let paint the picture for you your the killer level 10 rank 20 you get matched against 4 survivors level 30 35 32 45 you have 1 perk you can use say sloppy butcher ( makes them bleed more when you hit them) they all have 4 perks at their disposal lets say one has Saboteur (can disable your hooks and destory traps) and some other ultra rare perks to your common perk. You start the match finally knock down survivors to find there's no hooks nearby (due to saboteur) to hang them on and the nearest one is so far away that they can wiggle free from your grasp before you get there. Annoying huh? especially when all this could be avoided by matching you against players of a similar skill instead of throwing you in a blender against the best of the best as a new player.Now some things to mention these problems could change and some of these problems could be addressed in the future but I would avoid this game until then. Now some people may be fine with grinding and being used as a punching bag to higher rank players until they can level up and rank up themselves but im not if your fine with it then you may not mind this game.,Dead by Daylight,1,40,2487,486,1

3/31/2017,0,0,301,Recommended,Great fun can be had here. We all know the game is early access and that means you deal with the issues that come along with it. As far as my experence goes I have had a few issues with it being buggy. You get stuck in tight areas or on obstacles occasionally. Typacal server lag but honestly it hasn't been all that bad. For playing on Ultra settings I did expect more but I'm confident this will change as time passes.My biggest issue First off I have to say this because it's an issues with me. Games these days with the Pre release early access deal is crazy to me. If the game is a alpha beta whatever that's fine but trying to make money off a product that is not complete rubs me the wrong way. I get it this is the way games seem to go these days but personally its a $15 game (IF) it's to be released in this format. $30 is high to me. Maybe I'm wrong its just my opinion. I would say the same for a AAA title being droped as well. Again this is only my own issues with company's these days and doesn't reflect on this games playability or performance.Jumping in this game is ATROCIOUS! Edging and generally maneuvering over objects is a pain the the A$$. It can be the end of the match for you if you are not extreamly carful. I'm sure this will be adressed as updates contune to drop and its not a deal breaker just annoying.Framerates are up and down but never unplayable (for me atleast). I'm usually in the 60's.Plenty to do (for the moment) to keep you busy and screaming wondering where you got shot from!I would like to see more weapons in the game and interesting ways to kill. Maybe being able to setup traps with the environment or somthing would be fun or deployable traps to snag players chasing you.I think this is a fun game and with friends it makes the replay value high.My setup i7 6700k stock 4.0 clockAsus Progaming Z170GTX 1080Windows 10 Regular 7200 rpm HDD,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,301,1888,359,1

5/27/2017,0,0,884,Not Recommended,"I used to love this game.The devs are going the way of DayZ nerfing everything never addressing long standing problems most of the promises they made early on will never come true and they completely don't understand what it is that made this game fun and approachable in the first place and they've made yet another generic crafting/grinding game with occasional PvP that is so laughably one sided most of the time that its just frustrating for new players to start. They've developed themselves into a corner.This game also lost its ""rustiness"" at some point along the way. Look at the early concept sketches and how cool this game COULD have been if they had gone the way they originally intended.According to the concept materials Rust was supposed to be a game where you had to scavenge for basic things like boots springs little bits of metal rusty pipes etc and craft crude weapons out of them. This game was never meant to have fully functional assault rifles at least not as a craftable thing. In a world like the original Rust finding an assault rifle or army helmet would've been seen as godly in a world where everyone is rocking spears and bows and the occasional pipe shotgun.We were meant to be naked starving and primitive with occasional luck finding something from the ""old world"" that could be used to help us in some way like finding street signs and sharpening them down into weaponry or fashioning armor out of them or finding bits of metal wood glass etc and building a shelter out of that.Now this game is a grind. Get ready for the excitement that hitting trees has to offer. Brace yourself for the blazingly awesome time that is hitting rock after rock after rock for stones/metal/sulfer. Get your camera out and capture the raw beauty that is a janky twig staircase that was used to bypass any and all security measures you can hope to put down. You don't play Rust for your own personal benefit/gain you're just gathering resources for whoever the biggest clan on the server is.The inherent problem with a game like this is that you're almost required to build a big base which they will wait until you are offline to raid and once you're offline there is NO WAY to know you're being raided unless you get ""lucky"" and log in mid raid. All of the turrets/traps in the world don't matter if you don't have a way to know you're being raided when offline. Base building games are only fun if they are designed that way from the start and properly thought out from that perspective. Rust is trying to be a PvE survival game a hardcore PvP game a base building tower defence game and Minecraft all at the same time and it doesn't do any one of those things really well.PvP is broken and unbalanced. Base building is a joke in terms of flexibility and design and even more of a joke in defense. They are slow to help solo players and quick to help the large groups.Rust was best when it perfectly filled that void between casual game and hardcore game.Rust should be two different games. One a modern shooter with all the armor and high end guns and focus on big bases/clans that Rust has now and the ""Caveman simulator"" a lot of us wanted back when it first came out with spears/bows/scavenged stuff with small primitive shelters. They'd make more money anyways and have a bigger over all community... seems win/win to me.",Rust,1,884,3344,598,1

The other day doing a mission in public online running a semi had some guy try to jack my load was fun as hell trying to keep him/her from getting in frount of me. ended up blowing up his/her car. was fun untill his/her friend showed up and sniped me out of the cab. pluss side still finished the mission. in all its a fun game. but like any other game allways have trolls out there that will do anything to make it not fun for you but at least can jump from server to server to get away from the trash. The biggest grip i have about the game is the consant haven to resign up as ceo or such to do thing in i.e. office bunker. and really hate the keyboard control for flying being left handed its damn near imposible to fly might have to buy an xbox controler for it. other wise i do enjoy the game.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,348,1076,217,1

Super fun for solo play as the killer or 4 player group play as survivors. Both sides require quick thinking and it constantly keeps you on your toes. The only slight downside is that survivors can all be grouped up in ""survive with friends"". For new killers it can be hard to fight against people who are able to talk with one another(there is no voice chat in game).",Dead by Daylight,5,233,481,92,5

7/11/2018,0,0,16,Not Recommended,"This is one of the worst things i've ever played in my entire life. Easily one of the worst battle royale games which is saying a lot because the battle royale genre is already just a terrible lackluster genre that should have been a side mode to a base game. this ""game"" somehow lacks more content than a military shooter set in ww1/ww2 the variety is restricted to 3 maps of course for balancing reasons the only unlockables are cosmetics and ranks the actual incentive to play the game is mostly carved out and resold through a season pass you have to pay for every few weeks when plenty of other free to play games give you daily/weekly challenges completely free on top of that some of the unlocks through that pass are temporary let me make that clear TEMPORARY. so not only are you paying for your own psychological manipulation to make the grind more interesting you don't even get to keep some of the things you earn. oh and this on top of the Valve style loot crates where you have to buy both the crate and the key making things needlessly more complex and confusing for an already scummy system.the game is a buggy unpolished mess that runs very poorly especially when compared to other games that look about the same and run fine and what do the devs do about any of this to try and fix the issues and make the game the best it can be? absolutely nothing actually wait they are doing something they are trying to sue multiple people to sustain a monopoly on the genre so that you only have the one choice if you go to the battle royale genre for your daily dose of waiting in the loading screens and prematching all day long.i can go on for longer but i don't want to waste time just stay as far away from this game and the Battle Royale genre as a whole. i've played many battle royale games to try and understand the appeal and for the most part this genre for me will stay as a thing i only turn on because my so called ""friends"" couldn't buy anything decent. I absolutely cant wait for the day that this dies off the fact that this is popular is like watching people beg for less content in video games.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,16,2120,400,1

7/8/2016,0,0,821,Not Recommended,A typical game on Rocket Lag 3...2...1... we all go for the ball! Oh yes... I got there first but it still rebounds into our end as usual. We manage to recover and after a couple minutes' hard graft we score at last. The crowd goes wild with chants of 'savage... savage... savage... chat disabled for 1 second'.A short time later we suddenly get another on a flukey bounce off the wall oh the poor sods! We are leading 2 0 with only a minute to go. Surely they cannot come back now.Then 3...2...1...lag!! What's this?? I race for the ball but miss it entirely due to lag. Unfortunately it hasn't affected them so all I can do now is watch it sail majestically through the air... right into our goal.Oh well no need to worry we are still leading 2 1 right? But seconds later the lag strikes again. The ball jitters left and right. My car is on the floor then suddenly driving on the ceiling and I am powerless to stop them scoring another. The game is now tied but hopefully the server will sort itself out before overtime. Must stay on the defensive!With 2 seconds to go the ball now utterly possessed decides once again to manifest itself in our goal. Oh how quickly the tables have turned but not due to skill or even blind luck! Annoyed and feeling cheated I quit the match immediately.A great game ruined by the omnipresent and oft reported lag problem.,Rocket League®,1,821,1357,251,1

7/15/2018,0,0,454,Not Recommended,Ive put over 400 hours into this game since early alpha... honestly its gotten worse over time. When it first came out and after a lot of the first updates the game was looking good and i played it a LOT. Devs cared about the game and the issues and every update seemed to make everything better. But somewhere along when miramar got launched this game started to really suffer... at least in my eyes. The desync issues random crashes laggy hit reg just make me hate this game even though I love the gameplay and the concept. As of right now I can't really understand how they can claim this game is tournament ready or competitive mode ready at all... I literally chuckle every time i see the PUBG Invitational background. It just seems so ridiculous. I could care less about new maps and skins and vehicles as long as the CORE gameplay is really refined and well tuned. Fixing the desync lag and random crashes (crashes that i only have experienced after the last update) would make a world of difference. Maybe the devs just made too much money too fast... I can only hope that eventually I can redact my verdict on this game but for now not recommended at all. Good concept good feel poor optimization. It's really killing this game for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,454,1244,227,1

4/15/2015,2,3,0,Not Recommended,"I went through total hell with this game and it would take me several hours to write down exactly what went wrong and what I had to do in order to fix the problem... So I am going to give you the short version.Needless to say I (just like so many of us) have waited about 2 years to play this game. Rather than buy it for either my PS4 or Xbox One I chose to do the time and wait until this supposedly much superior version of GTA V is to be released for the PC. I waited and waited and waited until the day had finally come for me to experience the GTA universe in 4K resolution at 60fps! Naturally I pre downloaded it which forced me to look at the ""V"" icon sitting on my desktop just daring me to double clikc it. When the moment of truth arrived I double clicked the taunting ""V"" icon and was rewarded with a ""disc error"" message asking me to uninstall and reinstall it. I did which took roughly 3 5 hours. When I was finished all I had to do was log in to my good for nothing ""Rockstar Socialclub"" of which I care absolutely nothing about and happily begin playing GTA V. HeHe... man was I in for an unfortunate chain of events that would take me 24 hours plus some to find a solution to my dilema. Not to my surprise there were an extaordinary ammount of other unfortunate souls experiencing the same problem. According to all of the forums that I had read the last day and a half there are several different problems that are keeping GTA V from either installing or launching and to each one of those several different problems there are several different individual solutions to fix the problems. Understanding what was ahead of me and what I had to do was judt mind numbing. I was going to have to try each different fix and hope that one of them fixed the problem I was having. I got right to it... some fixes I tries several different times. Like making a different admin account for Windows Live... I tried that one... I actually made 8 different seperate Windows live accounts all of which I had to create a new e mail for (talk about time consuming and boring). I also tried several file change ups file rearrangements and other different fixes that people said would work. Finally aftera whole day of sitting at my computer and waisting time I had determined that I wouldn't stand for anymore of the bull $hit that I was putting myself through. I grabbed my keys walked out of my house (slamming every door behind me) got in my car and raced like a demon to my local Best Buy to purchase a physical copy of GTA V. It didn't help when the young girl said that they were out of it and I had to drive 9 miles to the next closest Best Buy. After I had the box in my hand I quicky returned home and opened the box only to realise that the game was 7 discs... SEVEN DISKS!!! There goes another couple of hours (or it seemed like it anyways). Finally when the game finished I logged into Rockstar Socialclub (with a new account to be safe) and crossed my fingers. It worked but now I had to wait another hour for Rockstar to upload a new update. When all is said and done my solution of buying a hard copy worked. GTA V is absolutely gorgeous at 4K resolution and 60fps... Only when it decides to work though. I have a high end system that well exceeds the suggested specs... Majorly well exceeds! My system runs perfect. I 3dmark my rig every other day and manualy defrag each hard drive every 2 days. I download all of my music. movies and anything other than games on my laptop. I have never had a problem with any game running at ultra or super high specs... NEVER! GTA V is the first game that has given me any type of trouble. Believe me... When the game is running it is beautiful and unlike anything I have ever experienced in a game. The are no glitches and it runs smooth as butter. Like I said... This is when it runs. GTA V decides to crash on me a lot. It usually happens right after I complete a mission when the game trys to auto save... Boom... Like clock work! Usually I'll play a mission it will crash. I will replay the mission it will save. I will play the next mission and it will crash again! Its a pattern! As for everything else... The controls are tight (almost too tight in 1st person driving mode) Super sensative The wind blows and you are moving across 3 lanes of traffic! 1st person feels like it is right at home. It's comparable to good fps titles. The graphics are amazing and anyone with the capabilities of 4K res at 60fps is gonna be in video game heaven! everything looks so real. Especially the lighting and shadow effects. The pier at night is extraordinary with it's glowing neon boardwalk. I am sure that when all of the bugs are fixed that this game will be well worth $60 but right now? Unless you are a complete diehard GTA fan and do not care about hassles bugs and glitches as long as you get to play GTA V even a little bit I wouldn't but it. I am a diehard GTA fan so to me it was worth it. Ill continue to play through the crashes and eventuall it will hopefully be fixed. Thank God Steam refunded me my money back though! If that didn't happen I would have been extremely heated! I do understand what it is like now to spend money on a game and the game not working... At ALL! I will no longer judge others who gripe and get really mad when something like that happens. It was an awful experience that I hope never happens again. You just feel so damn cheated and jipped. Like no one cares that you spent your hard earned cash for nothing. It's a feeling I will never forget.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,0,5533,1061,1

At Gamescom they had an invitational and focused on that along with the Xbox version but no real changes have taken place in the past month. It seems like a cash grab at this point because if you see their Bluehost profits they have more than enough people to pay to add more content and features especially since it's using UE4 which is a relatively simple industry standard. So the vote has been changed to a downvote. I get it care about making more money but that seems like all it's been the original idea was 6 months in EA not an eternity.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,167,627,117,1

Waste many hours of your life on a poorly optimised deathmatch/cluster before you die and start from scratch again.

5/14/2016,0,0,795,Recommended,Rust is a pretty amazing game in my opinion even more so for still being in Alpha. The game is a wonderful mix of both FPS action and creative buiding. The ramp up of creating your weapons and base make it either very rewarding to defeat another player or group of players or very destructive when you lose. The fact that you worked for what you have makes in all the more thrilling and motivating when you get in a battle.The community is the most important part. 90% of the content in this game is player created and it opens the doors to limitless possibilities and encounters. Also the Rust development team is one of the best in the industry when it comes to communicating with the players!Moreso than any game I have played this game gets my heart racing. It is a hard game. Rust is unforgiving unfriendly and unmatched. And I think it is one of the best games on the steam marketplace right now and that it will be one of the best in the near future.

However i've come to learn that this game is more like that highschool girlfriend that you thought was great but decided to move on and try better things. A few months/years down the road you think ""hey! i'll look her up and see how things are going"" ... so you decide to invite her out on a date spending about an hour downloading I mean preparing for the date... When you finally see her again you realize quickly that she's nothing more than a cheap wh*re these days selling herself for cheap tricks. You think ""hey I get it... girl's gotta eat..."" but then when you think about going down that rabbit hole again you quickly realize its a gaping stargate of a hole down there having been plowed by God knows who.

Been rank pushing the leaderboards a few seasons now but it's just impossible due to bugs game mechanics that suck cheaters or other stupid reasons. Been constantly top100 EU Duo each season but as soon as we come close to pushing the ranks further everything just flips out and you lose all motivation. Last few games *Died due to ""cannot exit viechle"" bug x3*Died 2m around a corder due to ""client side hit detection"" (on the laggy ruski screen I'm still visible even though I moved around that corner 4 seconds ago). x2*Game crashing randomly bug x3*Cheaters x2Prior to the last patch we died around 20 times due to a bug where the tricycle flipped 200m up in the air while driving on straight asphalt.You don't see your squadmates kills/knocks in the killfeed either since 3 patches back. However the devs instead of fixing this game breaking bug decides to release weapons crates and introduce more micro transactions.Don't buy this game it's soooooo far from finished or even close to beeing competative.

12/28/2017,0,0,935,Not Recommended,Edit Too many modders. It was bearable at one point to deal with them but now there are way too many. Teleporting everywhere and giving me an disconnection error if I don't treat them like king and queen. Too many military vehicles that result in GTA becoming cluttered with cancer and a fair few of the worst ones can be called back in almost immediately. Rockstar's response? None. xdA semi long pros and cons list from a player who has spent 1 200hrs on PS4 and over 420+hrs on PC who hasn't been banned/hasn't had their characters wiped. If I get banned I have my character on PS4 to play with. I don't mind that.Pros Massive fun to be had alone or with friends. PvP is really fun in freeroam or in deathmatches when there's no modders. A lot of the community are grinders and don't mind lending a hand when it comes to helping others making money. Crews and bikie gangs are a fun way to experience Online if you're into that sort of thing. Plenty of R*/community made deathmatches and races to keep you entertained. More than enough ways to make money in this game to get the things you want. DLC to keep the game fresh and alive. The world itself is nice to explore and mess around with. With friends or without. Vehicle handling is pretty nice. I consider it better than GTA IV's which some claim to be better than V's. Rockstar Editor is avaliable to those who want to make a mini movie for their 20 subscriber YouTube channel.Neutral Money. Once you obtain a bunker and a bikie drug business money is easy to get from there but it takes a bit of time to get those. You go to your bunker/business pay for supplies and wait for them to be used up by playing the game then once it's all done you sell it. Heists missions new adversary modes etc are also quick ways to obtain money. Grinding isn't all that hard nor will you have a terrible experience with it but it takes a bit of time getting the things you want. Getting targeted by griefers makes it fun as well. Rockstar's Support. I have never been banned so I cannot relate to any of the people who may have been falsely banned for nothing. In my experience I have never had an issue with R*s support when I submit a ticket. They get the job done for me. Loading Times. An average of 5+ minutes to load in from a 7200RPM 1TB WD HDD. After that loading screens are much shorter and not frequent. Unless you want to join a deathmatch through the Quick Play app on your phone. That will range from finding a deathmatch in 10 seconds or waiting 6 minutes to join a deathmatch that turns out to be a parkour map.Cons The community. Many are paranoid of modders and it makes PvP annoying since they'll accuse you of hacking report you and leave. Unbalanced. Rockstar did a great job with the Ruiner 2000 and then they gave up soon after that. Deluxo's missiles are OP the Oppressor (AKA Broomstick) is annoying and can be called to your location instantly after it gets blown up. Khanjali tank and MKII Oppressor is the go to noob vehicle for when you get dominated. The orbital cannon is perfect for people who care about 1 0s. It used to be Hydras and Lazers that were the issue but not anymore. Now it's all this P2P. Although you can play with mates that are on the other side of the world with 400 ping with no issue good luck if you anger some Chinese men and they grab your IP. Anticheat. What anticheat? Sometimes it works. Summary..I love this game but it can be pretty terrible to play. Despite that though there is a massive amount of fun to be had in this game and I do not regret the large amount of hours I've spent on this game. I'm not worried about getting falsely banned but we'll see what happens.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,935,3672,689,1

4/27/2015,0,0,80,Recommended,Bought the game after debating whether it was worth 60$. Lets see single player is great no problems their nice and long with alot of to keep someone busy.. But lets look at GTA Online... Its matchmaking is difficult to learn for someone new trying to set up their own private match. Connection between people with internet vs good internet is completely unbalanced and unfair. What I mean is people with internet will literally jump fly and do all sorts of fancy tricks across your screen in turn affecting the npcs around you. Not fun... Now let me get onto the Heists im still new so i only got the first heist but doing this with my friend on the first part will 9/10 break when we are bringing the van back to my house. Makign me with three choices exit and restart get into another game and sit through a loading screen or pray that it decided to ing work... Might I also add trying to buy things in this game is annoying because I will accidently buy .. Oh and why cant I sell anything from a mistake at buying the wrong thing. Now seeing as I bought this game to play with friends and have fun the online aspect of this game is a BIG let down as half the time im lagging in my friends car or the mission keeps bugging out...

1/2/2018,0,0,107,Not Recommended,This game is a neat thing all of the best pieces of the PVP from something like DayZ or H1Z1 without the tedious crafting or respawning.I've put over 100 hours into it both in EA and 1.0 release and as it stands I can't reccomend it until Bluehole addresses the absolutely overwhelming issue with hackers (that has seemingly increased with the official release.) Of the 10 games I played even this morning at the time of review atleast 9/10 of those I was very obviously gunned down at over 500m by someone using an aimbot. Maybe once the publisher manages to institute an autoban system it will clear up but for now steer very clear and take that valuable free time to a gamer where the publishers value your time and money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,107,725,132,1

Great story fun characters and a load of side stuff to do.Online is just mental. It's fantastic with friends but you can also get a lot out of it on your own.

6/22/2018,0,0,210,Not Recommended,"Well. I will try to be as fair as possible. I haven't write any review so far here but I decided to do so with this game as I have never encounter such a case before.So to keep it simple the game has very nice graphics and they are combined with pretty good movement too.The gamestyle is easy plain not complicated so anyone can learn to play easily.The two maps are nice and quite large even though I'd prefer more so it doesn't feel that repetitive.There are still some glitches especially with the movement and moving with vehicles here and there but overall I am satisfied by the quality of their work.As for the gameplay. As I said it is not complicated so anyone can play it. It has several modes solo which will place you against 99 individuals duo which will place you against 49 enemy teams of 2 people each and team of 4 which is against other teams of 4 and 3 people.It can either be played in FPS or TPS modes but whatever mode you pick it means that everyone in the team is pretty much onto the same mode. Of course while of TPS you can always zoom in to FPS viewing mode at any time during the game.The difficult part comes to spotting the opponents as the map is quite big and the other hard part is targeting. Headshots are effective but difficult to achieve and even with a bit of server lag you will find it hard to shot a moving target.But up to this point all is within the enjoyable limit. I will close this review with two simple sentences that actually ruin all the above.1. I have never seen so many cheating in a game before and so unsuccessful attempts to counter hacking by a developer.Most of the time I lost my enemy achieved a headshot by having the target to clip right onto my head.2. The reward system is crap and that will make you loose interest especially when you see that they will start offering you more ""just simple appearances/clothes"" for several dollars. And even these dollars you might spend for nothing as the case that you will be opening might contain something that you already have.I do not suggest this game unless you are looking so spend 20 euros/dollars into a game that is already obsolete after 6 months of it's release. You will get angry due to cheating and bored due to the repetitive nature without an actual reward.If it was a free to play then sure I would suggest it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,210,2331,434,5

5/29/2018,0,0,567,Recommended,Im going to start of first and foremost If you're here to play this game competitively to want to tryhard every game and get as many wins and kills as possible you're in for a bad time. because every little bug or issue or slight random thing that happens will just cause you to get angry. This game doesn't do that. this game as an Esport or a competitive game does not work. At least very much not in its current state. Many games can be one or lost purely by the luck of where the final few zones spawn often forcing one team in a good position to move through the open to get into the zone and thus get killed by the team that had the zone spawn on them. HOWEVER! if you're in to have some fun. have a good high tension time get some kills and maybe get lucky and win a few games you'll have a blast. This game excells at heart racing action good teamplay and tactics tense moments and exciting firefights with a little bit of Micheal Bay ness thrown in for good measure. That is what PUBG excells at. I have played with friends who are super serious and tryhard. they hate it they rage. they call the game trash. I then go and play with friends who just play to have fun and we have a blast. That is what this game is best at.There is also this Hackers. yep. there are a lot of them. HOWEVER a good 90% of hackers in this game play in Third person mode only. I can play a week of first person games without meeting a hacker or a cheater on any server. But the second I play third person Its hacker after hacker after hacker. Along with this third person tactics of hide behind walls looking over them and whoever tries to poke or push first loses is legitimately terrible and completely unfun. First person is MUCH better for gameplay overall Which is unfortunate seeing as most people play third person anyway and I honestly don't know why.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,567,1846,355,5

5/23/2017,0,0,130,Recommended,"Let's go through a list of events that will take place to see if you like what you read 1. Join a lobby of up to 100 players waiting for the match to start.2. After countdown hits zero everyone is spawned inside of a cargo plane. Once you reach a certain part of the island you can eject from the plane at anytime you wish except at the end of it's flight path it auto ejects you from the plane and you go skydiving down with any others who chose not to eject.3. As mentioned above you skydive toward your desired location the parachute will auto chute if you choose not to pull the chute. You will then get to steer yourself toward any direction you please.4. You land on your feet. You search the nearest building for resources. Some games you'll find a M16 some a pistol and then some clothes and an iron pan. The randomness is refreshing.5. You ready to go look for others to kill? The more you kill the more your points rack up. Don't really care for leaderboards? Just run around find a vehicle fire shots into the air to lure others to the sound or whatever it is you love to do to pass the time. No telling where other players are.6. Large map how are you going to find anyone? Oh the map has a circle on it which is the ""Play Area"". This over time will shrink and anyone caught outside the circle is drained of their health until they die. So it's a few minutes here shrink a few minutes there shrink again until the circle gets so small there is an infinity chance the match will end quickly.7. Did you die already? It's ok. As soon as you die you are given your stats for the session and you can go back to the main menu to start another match with another 100 people. It's that quick and easy there is no waiting til the end of the match to watch it unfold... though I hope the option becomes available in the future. It might be fun to kick back and relax after a lengthy session.8. Rinse and Repeat.Note I have not done a duo or squad matchup.Recommend? I do if you can get your rig to give you some good FPS. Mine is decent I had to go through an act of Congress to fix some issues. (It was easy btw there was no one alive in Congress so I signed the act forms myself)If PUBG is not optimized well for you there is always the Steam Refund.Personally I just like to have fun collecting a few guns getting in a vehicle and drive around. Hell I'll get a jeep and sit in the #5 seat (Back seat middle) and see if anyone notices. Everyone has noticed me so far. One day I hope to sit back there and someone take the jeep without knowing I was there the whole time.""Ok it's just us two. I'm driving around he's gotta be here somewhere.""

12/22/2017,0,0,133,Not Recommended,THIS REVIEW IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR GTA ONLINEIt was quite astounding at first with heists missions many vehicle races great and interactive open world with full of things to do.Characters has lots of great customizations(E.G. clothes/costumes). There are many options to customize your vehicles as well. Rockstar brings out free updates regularly and very often which is good. But as you progress you will realize that it s totally a Pay 2 Win game that rockstar made to suck up lots of money into their pockets. You will always need to pay a lot to buy any property or vehicles(weaponized sports super cars) every upcoming updates releases very expensive content. The recent Doomsday Heist vehicles costs at least a million GTA$ and some even goes up to 6 million GTA$ without even any customization at all. The IAA Facility from Doomsday Heist also has a ridiculously expensive cost if you want to customize some parts.This game has enormous potential to become the biggest and most played open world game but Rockstar is putting out too much expensive content and it became a pay 2 win game. This game is unfair to many players that does not have extra real money to cash in and have fun. I hope that Rockstar would change a bit maybe give out real free content for all players to enjoy or give out a higher amount of free money regularly so that new players or poor players can enjoy paid content like weaponized vehicles and properties without the need to cash in a lot of real money into it.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,133,1497,264,1

If things like going toe to toe with monsters or bothering them from a distance paired with a developer who takes care of its games is also to your liking I don't believe you would be disappointed.Of course the choice is up to you and for that matter Yes you are perfectly able and allowed to try and tackle everything all by yourself. However for some challenges like sieges ( so far one ) it wouldn't hurt to at least bring one friend along.For me personally it's a nice game with just enough story behind it to justify the situation you end up in.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,935,804,152,5

The controls are great the visuals are stunning and even though it is an easy game to jump into mastering more advanced techniques is actually quite difficult. Be prepared for a learning curve if you want to go far in this game. Rocket League offers a bit of something for everyone even if you're not a huge soccer fan. The developers have put a ton of effort into this game and continue to do regular free updates. Anything you purchase is strictly cosmetic so it keeps the game fair.The only drawback I've found over my time spent playing this game is that the community can be pretty toxic. However this isn't always the case and the developers have been cracking down on the toxicity a bit more. Plus you have options to mute the various forms of chat in the game or all of them if you wish. Just try not to take things too personally and you should still have a lot of fun.

On my end I will just refund this game and get Conan Exiles.This is my review my point of view my reason to thumb it down accept it or leave it I don't care.Thanks for reading 3",Rust,1,0,1347,259,1

8/9/2018,0,0,10,Recommended,"First Impressions Review I'm new to the Monster Hunter series. I tried one game on my old PS2 more than a decade ago and decided it was garbage after 30 mins. I so glad that since then I've gone through the Dark Souls series and learned how amazing the hack and slash genre can be.Pros I love the feeling of exploration and discovery. This game does a great job of making it feel like every small thing you do is important and working towards something. Having lots of things to complete deeply satisfies my neurotype. The combat is great. Like Dark Souls you don't just run in a mash a button until things die. You have to be careful. You have to plan. You have to learn your enemy and only strike when the moment is right.I've just down the 3rd big monster and so far the difficulty has been very low. Maybe that's just because I'm used to Dark Souls but from what I've heard about the series it's going to step up big time so at the moment I won't say this is an official complaint.Cons The characters are annoying. I could tell just from the trailer and the hack job on the facial animations that good characters were probably not going to be the highlight of the game. But this game is not about that so I don't really care. There was an NPC constantly yelling ""Over here!"" at one point. Hope that stops. Maybe make an option to push a button for navigation help instead of that. Also and I'm just comparing this to Souls since that's my only hack n slash reference the combat mechanics seem a little bit clunky but so did Souls at first. As it turned out they were extremely refined and only had to be mastered. I'll assume for now this is the case. Overall I'm absolutely loving it. This is the first game in a while where immediately I can feel that it's special. I'm really looking forward to spending many hours on carefully planned hunts and heart pounding and hopefully much more difficult monsters. 10/10Edit Noticing almost all of the bad reviews are due to technical reasons. Runs like butter on my 2 year old pc. Gameplay seems to be top notch.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,10,2060,383,3
1/3/2017,0,0,417,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is one of those games you either love or hate for the majority of gamers there's no middle ground when it comes to DBD. Game mechanics are fairly simple and the objective play as well killers try and down/hook all the survivors to sacrifice to the Entity survivors try and activate enough generators to power the gates to exit the trial before being sacrificed. Gameplay sounds easy enough but the game itself has a fairly steep learning curve. Killers and survivors have various perks to unlock to give additional abilities as well as items (for survivors) and addons for items/killer abilities and offerings to affect gameplay for each trial. Developers are active in trying to balance gameplay but there are still balancing issues (nothing game breaking but sometimes frustrating). Devs toss out tons of DLC (and a suprising amount of free DLC too which is amazing) and for the most part have done well to get some licensing rights for some really cool killers (Michael Myers Leatherface Freddy Kruger). Love all the extra content they've released so far and have purchased it except for Freddy (they absolutely botched his mechanics completely). The community is really 50/50 in my opinion I've run into some really toxic people but I've also had the pleasure of playing with some really cool folks as well. In any event I'd say watch some Youtube videos to see if you're interested in the game and give it a shot if you see it's on sale. I'd definitely recommend this game but sometimes you have to accept you're going to get frustrated playing it (like getting face camped/tunnelled as a survivor or constantly getting insta blinded by a group of survivor friends as killer).,Dead by Daylight,5,417,1698,290,5

Holding down W + SHIFT so much they might as well rename this game to running simulator the devs even thought of that and included a auto run function. THANK GOD3. Toasting laptop up to a point where even the keyboard is pain to touch4. Oh wait you got a desktop? A friendly benchmark 300 Fps in CSGO &lt 60 fps in PUBG5. Turning your sound to max to hear those tasty footsteps then getting jump scared by a camper with a shotgun6. Highly addictive game no gf/bf7. Cheaters/glitch exploiters as this game is in development8. Winning that chicken dinner is literally as satisfying as eating one9. CHINA NUMBER 1!10. 中国人在中点跳!11. Squinting your eyes to see the small pixel of enemy miles away12. Sound is messed up. Gunfire from the front sounds like from the back. LOGIC? MY EARS ARE AT MY BUTT13. Most of the time you won't be able to see who's firing at you until you dieded14. You have 2 choices. First deploy in a highly populated areas like huge villages with lots of weapons drops but get killed as soon as the firefight starts. Alternatively deploy in a secluded area and get loot to be taken out later by other players with better drops. Both are equally fun15. If you have friends better co ordinate your deaths because either one of you died too early and get to watch for the next hour while your friend TRIES desperately to get 1st but never does.16. Oh i found AKM with no ammo...17. FINALLY ammo *tries shooting at some random guy a mile away and miss every shot because you have no sights*18. Pray your weapon drop is not a crossbow. 19. Tries to be a camper and listen for footsteps like a horror show ready to jump scare you at every moment20. Still remember H1Z1? Nah no one does21. Got in a room? Get teleported out of the room because lag says so22.

Ive played 42 hours to this game mainly with a friend in an official server making our own stuff. The game is fun taming dinos and riding them is fun and enjoyable but be aware of the following The game has been in development for years and is still not optimized. It will probably never will. Grinding. Expect hours of cutting bushes and smashing rocks for materials you need for building. Seriously its ridiculous. I rly hope they change this. (in the other version of the game ""Survival of the fittest"" this is not an issue as games last 1h) Prepare to come back to your base just to see it completely destroyed always.

If you prefer to solo or run with buddies. If you prefer going balls to the wall or slow and strategic. Or maybe you're the guy that likes to create traps and ambush people.The dynamics of the Map terrain vehicles and weapons gives you a lot of options. Similar games don't offer this sort of diversity they're either running simulators or driving simulators.The performance for this game is average.

Blood splatters reactions from victims running away in fear and how they react from the different ways they are hurt and sliced. How they keel over after being cut for the first time and then try to crawl away leaving a blood trail to follow. As the killer you decide whether to finish them off there or pick them up and bring them to an old rusty hook used to slaughter animals and rip the hook into the victim's back or shoulder while they are still alive like one of the dripping carcasses they suspend from it after skinning their animals.Bad Still in BetaCan't change controls too wellGlitchy and low fpsSlow load timesGraphics arn't the greatestSummary Great concept and feel.

The sun is setting and the lights of the city stand out against the darkening sky.I get on my dirtbike and find a trail and can almost feel the wind in my hair as I traverse the narrow mountain trail. A coyote darts out in the path ahead of me in the twilight and I almost hit him which would send my bike end over end into a ravine. My heart jumps and I feel the adreniline rush as I navigate the narrow trail in the fading light. I am almost at the bottom and my bike hits a stone and I flip over and land head over heels and end up in a ditch. Ouch That's gonna leave a mark..... I get up brush myself off and call a taxi to come pick me up as my bike is a twisted pile of steel and rubber.What a rush. What a beautiful place.....So why am I such an A hole.I have never felt so divided by a game in my entire life. Let me make one thing clear. I am not some self righteous prude that things video games are evil and need to be banned. I remember the first time I clobbered a waste barrel in doom and took great delight in watching the imp disintigrate into a pile of gore at my feet.But GTA V is sometimes so hard to love. This is because your main ""characters"" are people with little if no redeeming features whatsoever. Now I get it GTA has never been about being a ""good guy"". But usually even ""bad guy's"" have some redeeming features. The closest thing to a ""hero"" in this game is retired gangster Michael that is in a dead end marriage with D bag kids (ones a stoner millenial and the other is....well not a virgin by a longshot) and a nice comfy house in Rockford Hills that he seemed to only get because he screwed over his buddys a decade ago.The satire of the game is laugh out loud sometimes and I get where Rockstar is going. Missions like where you end up fighting aliens in a self imposed ""bad acid trip"" or high tailing it around town after you've caught ""America's Sweetheart"" in a rather compromising situation with a fellow teen star are riotous and hilarious. But then you get a mission like ""By The Book"" and .... If I ever have to do that mission again in my lifetime it will be too soon. I warned my friend about that mission and he said... What did you do knock off a pet store? ""I wish I had....I wish I had....""I love the game I love the environment and I love the beauty of the world around me. I'm just not a fan of who I am in it....And perhaps that's the point they're trying to make.",Grand Theft Auto V,4,114,2560,506,4

7/1/2015,0,0,238,Recommended,"Well what can I say? This is GTA for the PC. This is the 3rd copy of GTA I have bought to date going through 3 graphical stages with the copies. This is the ultimate version not to beat around the bush it is. I am not one of the ""PC master race I am better than you will ever be console peasants"" I have a diverse range of consoles all the way from the PS1 to the PS4 and PC I have now. Now the actual game. Well if you have played PS4/Xbox One GTA then you are going to be familiar with pretty much everything. PS3/Xbox 360 users might need some getting used to the new physics and 1st person but it is largely the same.Now for the most important bit about any game the gameplay. Now if you haven't played GTA yet (do you live under a rock or something?) then you can find reviews of the game that are far better than what I can put into words here just do a simple YouTube search and you should find some decent enough ones NerdCubed should be a good place to start. If you have then it is the same pretty much. Nothing to report about here.Graphics. Now the graphics on this game. Holy balls. Put this game onto max settings at 1080p and you could almost be fooled into thinking it was real life except when someone starts to fight you when you 'accidently' steal their car. As I have said I have the PS3 and PS4 versions of this game. Yes they are good. For PS3 GTA looked amazing considering it was running on almost 10 year old hardware. GTA PS4 is a huge step up from PS3 but it couldn't hold a candle to what GTA PC has to offer. I have an i5 4690k 8GB RAM and a GTX 970 and at 1080p this game runs like butter well used to I'll get to that soon. It runs at around 50 60FPS completely maxed and with some settings turned down to high but most still on ultra it runs at a constant 60FPS most of the time much higher in some places well into the 100s.So I have raved about this game a lot mostly for good reason but as with anything there is a down side. Well 3 in my case. 1. Glitches This game has a huge amount of glitches sometimes for good reason say that it crashes every once in a while that is fine. I can only really speak for myself here but I have only ever crashed 3 times in GTA PC once when I was in a heist very near to the end might I add and that really me off once when I was just driving around and another time that another glitch happened. This was a more 'catastrophic' glitch. This is when my GTA character temporarily lost their entire garage(s). This was when the game was only a couple of days old and I sort of forgive it and it did give me everything back after a patch but that was still worrying/annoying when it happened. 2. Rockstar's business strategy There has been many reviews souley focused on the Steam sale situation. That if you want to read just look around the reviews and shall give you an idea of what it is all about. This is more of a general look over. I'm probably going to end up ranting so you might not want to read my rant just skip a bit. Ok the game was a extreme commercial success on launch on PS3/ Xbox 360 and I imagine it didn't do too badly on PS4/Xbox One and PC either yet they still include micro transactions. On a mobile game a free one especially micro transactions are far from good but turning (sadly) into the norm but a game that costs a big some of money whichever way you look at it new it was 40 50 on PS3/Xbox 360 around the same foor PS4/Xbox One and 40 for PC yet they still charge real money to get virtual money in a game that costs 50 sodding ! Furthermore they charge insane amounts of money for DLC vehicles just to get you to spend more real money $85K for a smart car? $120K for a Skyline Peugeot 504 Lada hybrid? $400K for a FWD Citroen? No. No Rockstar no. I'm going to end this rant here before I fill up the entire page. 3. (yes this is still going and I want to finish what I started) Graphical issues I get a crap ton of micro stuttering and it has only been going on since May start of June ish and I couldn't name the update it started on because 1 its hard 2 I've been writing this for almost an hour 3 I really CBA but it is still really annoying making the game almost un playable. I happens mostly online so that might be something to do with the internet but that's by the by.Ok let's rap this up. I'm sure most people have given up reading this and have fallen asleep I sure would of but if you have made it this far then well done you. This game is definately worth getting but if you already have it then don't bother unless you are really unhappy with the console versions graphically. If you haven't bought it yet on consoles or PC get it. It is an amazing game and with friends for amusment I have racked up over 1000 hours on all the versions. That is one thing I would recommend with this game at least 1 friend I would say optimally 4 just for missions and things like that and this game will last you a long while and you will have a huge amount of fun playing it. Anyway I'm off to play GTA with self radio the one main feature I use on PC. Thank you Youtube MP3. Thank you.9/10 me.",Grand Theft Auto V,5,238,5095,1014,5

11/12/2018,0,0,458,Recommended,(If you are looking for a rating 1 10 please look at the bottom of this review)Dead by daylight is a multiplayer online game consisting of one killer and four survivors. The survivors are attempting to complete generators destroy potential hex totems that destroy select killer perks if chosen and rescue fellow survivors from the hooks the killer hangs them on before each phase runs its course and the survivor is sacrificed to the entity. Once all generators are completed the survivors must then open one of two exit doors and escape before the killer does what he was designed to do kill them. The killers goal is to eliminate all survivors before all generators are completed or before the last survivor jumps into the hatch (should 2 generators be completed). Pros to playing/owning the game Opportunity to play with your friends &amp work together versus a single target the killer. Many hours of enjoyable gameplay making new friends (and some enemies) along the way. A variety of different maps perks killers &amp survivors to aid in making each game unique when compared to the last. Nice survivor matching system generally enabling the killer (host) and survivors living within a fairly near range to versus one another leading to lower ping/lag enabling all parties involved to play the game. Fairly constant updates adjusting and rebalancing the game and all characters within it (buffing and nerfing as necessary).Cons Some minor bugs (decisive strike not working in survive/kill your friends having to get to 35% struggle in normal gameplay to trigger decisive strike if you aren't obsession hitboxes of killers too large when survivors vault through windows. Difficulty/wait time at higher ranks for killers and at times survivors to acquire games based on the in game ranking system team building mechanics. Nothing in place to deter killers from camping survivors hung on a hook thus ruining the game for the survivor in the long run. Overall rating 8.5 based on 355 hours of playtime,Dead by Daylight,5,458,2003,332,5

7/26/2018,1,4,444,Not Recommended,This game Dead by Daylight is quite a fun game. Actually when I bought this game I really had alot of fun playing it. At the time a bought this game (14 months ago) survivors were really strong. If you had some friends and you played SWF you could definitely make the killer ragequit. It was kinda like cyberbullying (insta flashlights vacuum pallets 100% healingspeed with selfcare infinites and so on). I am a survivor main myself (and a nurse main) and I defenintely agree with the recent patches which removed/changed broken survivor items perks or like serveral edits to maps. The only thing that annoyed me is that in nearly every patch the survivors receive a nerf. These nerfs aren't necessarily big but over the time the game it gets different the gameplay the items/perks you use the game you used to know. I personally don't like the current state of the game not because im a toxic survivor main just because the game changed alot. If you're a good killer you know how to play against survivors and get a 4 man almost every game. If you are planning on buying the game this will probably be how the game will look like for you at first sight. A bit unbalanced (LOL A BIT... A BIT.... ARE YOU KIDDING ME! LMAO ROFL) but it is still fun to play I guess. As long as you don't turn out like an Ochido wannabe have fun in your games of Dead by Daylight!Also wtf is going on with lobbysimulator and laggswitching killers.

Love the game.EDIT With the above still being said it still doesnt run. I can now hit 60+ fps. I have a 144hz monitor so it should get 144 but it doesnt feel as if it is true 144hz 144 fps. Its a shame because this game is fun and can be very good. BUT it doesnt run at all. It crashes all the time. I dont recommend this until it fixes so many of its bugs. These arent ""little bugs""... the game is lowkey broken. And yes as of right now it does deserve its only 46% positive reviews. Because the game developers are trying but in the wrong places.

12/24/2018,0,0,102,Not Recommended,"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!Not until the LAZY developers FIX the following things!I hear you ask ""Why you call them lazy?"" Because THEY ARE! I sent them countless emails about improvements bug fixes general fixes ideas etc and I didn't get a SIMPLE answer from them!It's a really nice and relaxing game BUT there are a looooooooot of staff that need to be added/fixed so we can keep playing calm.1. (FIXED) FIX this thing when driving the buggy/rover! I use the arrows instead of WASD and I can't steer my vehicle! I NEED the mouse to look around the vehicle not steering with mouse! Also! Up arrow means forward relative to the vehicle not relative to the camera! I have my mouse viewing the right side of the vehicle and when I press the vehicle goes RIGHT! What kind of mechanic is this? I haven't seen this before since THE FIRST HALO! (FIXED)2. Larger backpack capacity. Seriously! I have TWO hands and I can carry more things than this guy in the game! The following backpack attachments solar panel light oxygen tank and wind generator should take no space3. I want to change the terrain modules by pressing 1 2 3 etc. Not by opening the backpack &gt selecting the terrain tool &gt and adding/removing the modules. Also there's no need for the modules to occupy space. Do it like an ""update/upgrade"" on terrain tool. Also WHY THESE MODULES DRAIN POWER!?4. Here's the big deal. I built a smelting furnace on the one side of my base on the other side there's a vehicle bay. So if I want to build a vehicle I MUST carry the items with me! Insted of that since all the buildings are connected together the items would transfer among powerlines like a conveyor system.5. Make a cargo container.6. Also crafting items should be stacking like they are in Space Engineers Minecraft etc. I mean yes to build a buggy you only need 4 items (seat included) but that means half of the medium storage module. For example make a stack of maximun 9 of every item (9 resins 9 glass 9 scraps etc.) 7. A GPS system would be very very helpful.8. Enable us to build something to move in the air like a hover or a little plane (not nessesarily with aerodynamics physics) so we can roam around the planet. I know that launcing at the atmosphere and landing again is something new and convenient too so keep both.9. (FIXED) We NEED to dissasemble the modules from the platforms ex the ""Research Chamber"" from the ""medium platform A"". (FIXED)10. We need to deconstuct the buildings and return the half of the resources.EDIT 26 12 2018 (FIXED)11.(FIXED) FIX this thing with the key bindings! Every time I play the game I MUST change the keys to play. WASD is NOT convenient for me I prefer to play with the arrows! (FIXED)EDIT 27 12 201812. I went to Radiated planet and every 10 steps I had to struggle with INVISIBLE walls blocking my way! Also I couldn't build with my terrain tool every 10 steps too!EDIT 28 12 2018 (FIXED)13. (FIXED) FIX this thing with the planets! Everytime I go to space ALL the panets are ""deconstructed (FIXED)14. (FIXED)Came back to Terran planet from Radiated planet (Radiatied is a very windy planet) When I landed on Terran plants went crazy and the Astroneer was walking like there was a massive storm and protected his head head with his arms. THERE WAS NO WIND AT THIS MOMENT! I spent about TWO hours on Terran and the INVISIBLE STROM was there ALL THE TIME!(FIXED)EDIT 29 12 201815. I made a rover train of 4 rovers and ONLY the first rover has power to move the other rovers. Since they are CONNECTED they SHOULD powered and move all together with the same amount of energy like in Space Engineers.E_D_I_T patch 1.016. This game became havier than an aircraft carrier ship! We don't have NASA's hypercomputers! We don't even have Z1 gamings's PCs! Do you remember this testing buggy planet at the previous patch? Well now it's worst than that!17. EVERY single time I use the terrain tool it sounds and it moves like an AK47!RATATATA you ugly rock RATATATA usefull resin RATATA everything in the area!18. OXYGENATOR? REALLY!? R_E_A_L_L_Y??? Remove this thing! I prefer the tima that was FIXED on the Hub! Now I have to drive the rover with an oxygenator to provide me with oxygen!These at the moment. I'm sure I'll find more if I keep playing this game. Please consider my thoughts and keep pioneering!Now on the good impressions.1. The game is a really relaxing game the music is awesome for this kind of game. 2. You don't have to think how to spend resources there are plenty resources in every single pixel. 3. You don't have to worry about the power either the sun the wind and the organic are always there for you.4. Fun base building technique.5. The new cave system is AMAZING!6. Those purple ""pyramids"" are AMAZING too!",ASTRONEER,1,102,4740,846,3
7/10/2016,1,2,148,Not Recommended,After playing through the game pre and post xp update I have come to a final conclusion The community literally makes cancer look like a paper cut. While the game itself and its systems are well implemented the enviroment beautifully designed and the building system done well but slightly lacking the community is absolutely horrendous. Even if you find 3 nice people to play with you will get raided by 10 people harder up the than the 2016 Presidential Election will do the American public. 90% of people Kill On Sights (KOS) and the 10% that don't even though you may say friendly and just be starting out the game with little gear and resources will probably still kill you for fun. I would not be surprised if there was a psychological study done on the players of this game and find out that all of them are extreme masochists (taking pain repeatedly for joy) or sadists (having joy from hurting others) and probably also future serial killers. Most of this community should be put on government watch lists that's how bad it is and probably indicative of how they would act with actual guns and power in general.,Rust,1,148,1120,199,1

7/1/2017,1,2,111,Not Recommended,This game used to be great. I remeber first playing GTA online with my buddies in middle school on my xbox 360. The first time I logged in nobody had a super garage with 64 vehicles stored inside. it was survival in the streets of Los Santos everyone was scrambling to create their gangs and there was a mad rush to get the more powerful vehicles in the game (buzzard rhino tank etc..) It was an environment unlike any other I had ever seen in the gaming world It was amazing. But alas all good things must come to an end. Once they started coming out with these ridiculous DLC's with blatantly op weapons guns vehicles and so on it really ruined the game. And now they outlawed our mods? these guys. They dont deserve any of the money they've earned and I have no clue why this game is #2 on global top sellers in 2017. Very sad.

4/5/2017,0,0,184,Recommended,"After I played this game once or twice I didn't think it would honestly keep my attention very long. But I gave it another go and I really really enjoy this game. It kind of forces you to play as though you were actually on an island in a mass game of manhunt. You have to always assume some is behind a door in a house or watching you. It forces you to work tactically and is honestly a lot of fun. I really enjoyed DayZ but that has just turned into a kill on sight game anyway. I think the optimizations are pretty good at this point (I'm a software engineer) especially for early access. I have a pretty good gaming setup but nothing fantastical. Therefore I think a large percentage of you Steam folk have setups that can handle this game easily. I play it on the 'High' settings and am pretty sure I could get away with ""Ultra"" if I wanted to. The only 'Con' is that on the odd occasion a server 'drops' but that's somewhat rare and is obviously only going to improve!I'd definitely recommend you pickup this game and give it a try at least for 5 rounds.

8/20/2018,0,0,73,Not Recommended,This is the third time I have bought this game and have been a long time Monster Hunter Fan. I cannot recommend this PC version game to other people due to numerous connection issues and the fact it is lacking content that the console versions currently have. If you want a better experience with multiplayer with some more cool content and own a console buy the game on console. Additionally this game lacks anti cheat I have seen very interesting hunts where people are HR 999 they have high rank armor in low rank monsters are being one shot by a slinger etc. Although the hacking doesnt hurt other players like it would in other competitive games it still ruins the whole experience even if you are getting some free hunts due to those people.

10/18/2017,0,0,133,Not Recommended,DO NOT BUYI bought this game a while ago and it was fun at first. But once the devs stopped patching things added in paid loot crates and allowed cheaters to flood the lobbies the game ceased to be fun. Servers are absolute right now so don't expect to have a game without lagging at times the game is very poorly optimized so fps drops are extremely common and the combat is ed up in many ways. For some reason they decided that a 12 gauge shotgun shouldn't kill people at point blank range. I'm not joking or exaggerating when I say this either I had the semi auto shotgun with the barrel basically touchin the other person's chest fired twice hit both times and got one shotted by their pistol. this game.Right now PUBG gets a 4/10 from me. Would be higher if the devs actually worked on patching this ing mess instead of porting it to consoles.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,133,848,159,1
6/23/2018,0,0,179,Not Recommended,I can say for sure that I will never play this game again.In the beginning the game looked very promising but now it's just a disaster.Instead of fixing bugs or performance issues the developers are rather implementing new skins and new lootboxes. First there was just on key to unlock boxes which was okay I guess but now you have to buy specific keys to open specific lootboxes with real money.And if that wasn't enough you can now buy a so called Event Pass which gives you instant access to specific clothes and skins. You can also gain EXP through playing the game. If you reach a specific level you simply unlock stuff. Sounds good right? Yeah if there wasn't a stupid level cap which resets daily. I mean come the f*ck on! If someone pays for this stupid pass and plays a lot why in the hell limit the amount of level ups he can get?!?In summery the future of PUBG looks really dark. A lot of other developers are making similar and better games and it's just a matter of time before everyone stops playing this everlasting Alpha version of a game. The developers showed once more that they simply don't care about their fans and that they are just in it for the money. They try to get every last penny out of this game because they know that at one point everyone will have left for a game of one of their competitors.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,179,1326,247,1

8/2/2017,0,0,71,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is AWESOME!! The premise of the game is nothing new but this game manages to introduce some new features that make it play better than H1Z1 Rust and all of those other games combined. Matches don't last too long so you don't get invested enough to make you rage. I have never run into any cheaters whatsoever in this game. If you're looking for a fun pvp shooter with semi realistic combat then this is the game for you. Amazingly fun if you have at least one other person to play with as the style of gameplay changes. 11/10 reccommend to anyone looking for a fun shooter.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,71,610,113,3

This game will never update. this game will never be anything more than a bunch of cavemen running around naked with rocks. The houses you build even if they're metal will decay over time. The time you accumulate in the game does not mean much in the grand scheme of things especially if your house decays in the process. I think the blueprint idea is neat and that is truly what makes your character unique from the rest but there has still not been a single update I've been impressed with.

5/18/2018,0,0,59,Recommended,Product received for free. This game is intense good graphics and enjoyable to play. There were some cheats which ruined the game but this seems to of died down or targeted more by the Developers. This game is now one of my favourite pc games as a casual gamer but some players in this game are too good or play to much due to thier skill. Luck plays a big factor at times with loot etc.. Overall 2.5/5Update After 60 hrs of gaming this game is still enjoyable at times but has now been flooded again with cheaters lag and no support by the developers. After continous updates the game now crashes more often extra lag (not my computer) and the recoil and gun balance stupid. The only way to avoid recoil is to get your gun maxed out with upgrades or have a cheat added on. I for one love the graphics of PUBG but a lack of support from the developers who are only interested in your money and Esports has turned me off. I for one will now board the Fortnite ship. (It's free fun and better support from Epic).,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,59,1010,193,3

7/25/2018,0,0,370,Not Recommended,I think this game is super addicting. I really enjoy playing it with friends but I think that th developers have a lot more work to optimize this game...A LOT more work. That being said PUBG is NOT worth $30.Personally I've had really good games and then I've had extremely games where Asian hackers or graphics completely ruin the game. The thing is that if you play on the lowest graphics setting grass won't render that far meaning that if someone let's say 100m 200m out is laying in grass you won't see the grass but you'll see the person. Not only that but I hate that no matter what I'll be spending half the game looting or running across the map and die just like that.Not only that but playing most of the maps you'll find yourself in the middle of butt nowhere. I mean literally half of the map is just empty space...not so realistic imho. The thing is that the developers don't really focus on optimizing the current maps they only care about pushing out new content which in turn is (except the 4x4 map...that's an ok map).The really ed up thing is that I keep getting sucked into this game because 1. I don't really care for building in ing Fornite and 2. I honestly can't ing find a decent battle royale game to play and love WITH FRIENDS.On a side note I think I'd like this game so much more if I didn't have to play with people from another country (aka ING ASIA at least the one's who don't know how to speak English.) It really ruins the game for me.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,370,1470,277,1

4/21/2015,0,0,109,Recommended,First ImpressionsHaving played neither the console version nor any other game in the series I was pleasantly surprise by how much effort has been put into the game by Rockstar which is good considering that they must have delayed the game at least three or four times. It also runs fairly nicely on my dual core CPU providing it is set to high priority in the task manager wih the lowest the framerate ever drops being around 45FPS and maintaining a solid 60FPS indoors and in enclosed locations. I can safely say that the CPU is the bottleneck here and I can crank the game up to maximum setting without a performance change (graphics card being a GTX 970). The game is very well optimised.OverviewYou are placed in the role of the three protagonists who can be switched between at most points in the game all with very well portrayed and unique personalities unlike some (I'm looking at you Aiden Pearce). While the story can be slow moving at some points the heists and parts which involve actual gunfights and car chases really make your heart pump (and you feel cool after a getaway on the side) and the sidequests are fairly in the sense that some can be extremely fun and others can be you towing a car from one place to another for five miles).WeaponsThere are many weapons which can all be customised with attachements and skins all with slight or major variations (i.e. a heavy handgun is a lot more different to a grenade launcher than it is to a pistol). None of them are overpowered or underpowered.VehiclesThe wide range of vehicles is great especially with some being fairly unique (like a supercar with a reflective silver paintjob). The main types of vehicles are cars bikes planes boats and helicopters with a few sub categories like quad bikes and jetskis.OnlineThe online play is by far my most favourite aspect of the game from thrilling heists to car chases to buggering about shooting stuff up it's all there. It's like the singleplayer but with more features it is also so much better with friends.ConclusionThe game is amazingly well optimised with solid gameplay and an infinite amount of detail way to much to list and many aspects likely still to be discovered.Overall I award this game a score of 8.5 out of 10,Grand Theft Auto V,4,109,2239,394,4

It was an amazing game but in truth has always been lacking a bit of replayability in single player. Instead of giving the player what he/she wants and releasing some DLC or letting players introduce some fun and new content for the game they come in and take it all away just because of a few bad players. Protect the online let single player be creative. Until then I cannot recommend this game at all. Save your money and buy something else.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,427,602,114,1

4/23/2016,0,0,183,Recommended,If you have some good Matches its fun and with a good team its even better.As always in such PvP arena games...I don't know how good or bad matchmaking is but it seems that singleplayer or 2 player teams always have a massive disadvantage cause they often get beginners and lowskill Soloplayers in their team and get matched against premade teams. Even if you have a good team the matchmaking rips it apart and takes good teammembers from your team to the enemy team after one match.Events are fun and you get some things for your cars or something.Also many games there are too many unskilled players or trolls just jumping around stupily and disturbing more then they help. So even if you shoot 2 4 Goals on your own you get even more goals against your team cause some players are too confused with thier steering and just go for the ball like lemmings or bots skip the ball to the enemy or shoot owngoals.So in the end most of the time you have to watch for your own random teammembers that they don't ruin the game and this is extreme annoying after a couple of games even if you win.After so many games I can only partly recommend this game cause it is no fun at all if you see that you can win a game nearly alone cause the enemy is weak and just one unskilled player can ruin it all. And this is happening in 6 of 10 games. Or you get matched as soloplayer in 0 6 games with one minute left. But the rest of the games it is fun buy it in sale.,Rocket League®,4,183,1451,280,4

Some hosters spawn first in line so they turn OFF catchup &amp slipstream then you can't get first place at all since they'll just speed off with glitches and whatnot.

In order to have actual fun you'll have to take a time machine and travel to 2013 2014 then you can start making money and by 2018 you'll have some cash to around with.WARNING Online mode is a pay to have fun mode since you can't earn reasonable amounts of money without buying sharkcards ( i haven't bought any ). You will have to become a basement dweller that hasn't had a in 6 months and didn't sleep for a millenia constantly playing and grinding in order to earn money. You won't see your loved ones for 3 years minimum.I regret buying this game since I am able to aquire it for free just without online mode. Don't buy it rather download it from internet for free since the developers took a huge on the GTA Franchise.

1/25/2014,0,0,22,Recommended,This game is good for 3 kinds of players.1. SociopathsPeople who enjoy shooting noobs in uneven matches or who enjoy ruining other people work for sweet sweet tears in chat. They are probably not skilled enough to excel in pure PvP combat games where everyone is on equal footing teamwise and gearwise.2. Team playersCould be either group of sociopaths but even of normal people as being in group makes this style possible. I can see how few teams waging wars against each other and raiding their fortressses in more controlled and fair fashion. Still groups of sociopaths who kills everyone seems prevalent.3. Solo player vs. enviroment aka Robinson CrusoeIf you enjoy crafting building your existence from nothing survival in nature and exploring surrounding terrain this game is also nice for you. For your enjoyment you should choose empty or almost empty server or you fun will be most likely destroyed by others. PvE aspect of this game is not deep enough yet but you can get around 20 hours of fun for your money.Also be wary of servers named Friendly PvP or similar. It is either evolution of regular PvP where creators of theese servers hope to lure noobs to feast on or even if their intent is nice sociopaths are migrating here in hopes to get more easy prey.,Rust,3,22,1270,220,3

8/12/2018,0,0,20,Not Recommended,This game is so boring you can not imagine it. If you have a low or mid range PC you are at a serious disadvantage because the game is so unoptimized the framerate drops to single digits when you get into a conflict. That takes all the fun from the game. The game goes like this Loot &gt Camp &gt Loot &gt Camp &gt Loot &gt Camp. A new player with a high end PC using a pistol can kill you even when you have full lvl 3 gear and best guns. That's how unoptimized the game is. And that's not the only boring part. The most boring part is there is nothing else to do. A full price game that only has two huge and one middle sized map and nothing else to do other than loot camp shoot and die. I have this game for two or three months and I only played for 17 hours and most of them was on the first week. I would refund it if I could.

1/2/2019,0,0,532,Recommended,Hello everyone When PUBG first came out I was not really interested in it because at the time I was playing more of CSGO. I eventually bought the game however in December of 2017 and I haven't looked back since. I have been enjoying this game so much due to its uniqueness (PlayerUnknown was the first guy to introduce the battle royale genre in gaming even though he did so in ARMA first). After having 485 hours on the game here are some things that I find great about this game and other things which need improvement. The main reason that I love this game is that it is different every time you play it. I haven't had the final circle end at the same exact location ever since I bought this game which means that every time I queue up for a game there's an element of surprise of what I will encounter. I think this is the more significant point for me because I'm not constantly running towards the same area but rather get to explore different parts of the map and battle other players differently each time depending on where the encounter occurs. In addition since I bought this game there have been numeours updates to it (majority of which have been beneficial) so from that you can see that the developers somewhat care about this game and are constantly pushing out new updates. PUBG has come a long way since it was first released and since I bought it. At the time there were only two available maps (Miramar and Erangel) and some aspects of the game were different as well. Vehicle physics bullet penetration and the maps themselves were all different and have been modified in a positive way since then. Vehicles used to be extermely unsturdy and easy to flip but thankfully they have been fixed since then. Some things that could be improved are that the weapon spawn rate should be increased on Erangel and the game still is not fully optimized as it should be. I along with majority of the other players have mini stutters at times which can become annoying. They don't occur all the time though but it would be nice if the developers fixed this issue once and for all. I don't like the Sanhok map but that's personal preference. The game can be very frustrating at times but that's just the nature of the game since you're always competing againsts 100 other players (if playing solo). However most of the time it is an extrordinary game that really gives you an adrenaline rush when the player count starts getting below 10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,532,2445,444,5

3/12/2018,0,0,255,Recommended,I have a complicated relationship with this game but i'm to the point where i can comfortably say i really enjoy it.I started out being too afraid to do much of anything useful. This was back in October 2017 when I bought the game on sale to play with friends who had already been playing. We played some kill your friends together to get the hang of the controls and objectives.After that we jumped into Survive With Friends where we were afraid but we were afraid together. I'll never forget the time we were all sitting in the open exit gate area and Freddy Krueger popped some sort of perk that blocked the exits for a period of time and we all panicked and ran around laughing and freaking out.But then we started playing less because it was frustrating waiting any where from five to fifteen minutes to get into another game if one of us died early and had to sit around and wait for the others.Shortly after The Pig DLC was released a friend and I decided to play some ol DBD cause nothing else sounded fun to play. First game of the night was with The Pig. We knew it was her because we saw the puzzle boxes. I started working on a generator and after twenty seconds i see her about fifteen feet away stalking me and it scares THE SHIRT out of me. I mean I threw my mouse away and half closed my laptop screaming WHAT THE FORK in a VERY high pitched tone. To my credit I hadn't been playing seriously and all other killers (besides the shape but he was tall) had a terror radius that I relied on along with my friends callouts to avoid any surprises. Well that night with the Pig i only played two more games still shaken up. I even had a nightmare that i was being stalked in my own home by Hillbilly and Doctor.That next morning I decided I had to face my fears. No one was online so I logged in and jumped into queue alone. And you know what? I had so much fun. And I still do! I almost exclusively solo queue and now I play more Killer too! Today I bought the Halloween DLC and i had a BLAST playing The Shape no wonder everyone reccommends it! Remember that it is a multiplayer game so expect a certain amount of toxicity but I've found that as long as you throw the ol GG in at the end people seems to hold onto their EZs.This game gets a lot of hate for being such a creative immersive and addictive experience. It's not just one way to play it's many. The bugs have been annoying at times but I think DBD is at a great place right now. I don't play any games like DBD and I wouldn't have thought this was going to be something I'd like but it's one of my favorites to play after a long day in the office and I'm glad I gave it a chance! ),Dead by Daylight,5,255,2654,519,5

2/3/2018,0,0,1187,Recommended,This game can be the best or the worst game you have ever played you must have the right mindset to survive not only cause of the shouting kids and racist old men. but because this game is one whole big learning experience you learn something new almost every day you hop on and you cant give up. it may be hard at first but you gotta learn from your mistakes and you also gotta learn who to trust. This is an amazing game and is amazingly fun with friends and even solo but you have to be willing to put in alot of time and effort even some days. it is better to start with friends but you must learn how to survive on your own or else you probibly wont be the best but if thats fine with you do it. 10/10 Amazing game buy if you have time and or willing to try over and over.............oh yea btw the community is toxic af REEEE Danit0,Rust,5,1187,838,168,5

8/5/2015,0,0,204,Recommended,"Well this game took a couple years to make and 101 hours for me to finish the storymode so I think it's justified to give it a detailed review. (Hopefully free of spoilers.)Having carried my save through from The Witcher 1 to Witcher 2 and finally into this game I can very strongly say that this was the best game. And here's why Firstly the story. The Witcher 1 and 2 were both very depthful incredibly immersive worlds with a solid storyline to back it. This story wasn't just solid however. It was surprising serious sad funny happy. The flow of the game's story takes you to familiar places and completely new lands you've only heard about.The plot itself is awesome Geralt's quest to locate Ciri caught up between a war between the North and South. This makes for really tough calls that Geralt is charged with making and sets up for heavy concequences down the line. A game with a potential of 36 end game states means that there's a lot of areas you can go right in and some where you might go wrong. However the thing I truly loved about this game can be summarised in two words I heard somewhere ""Moral ambiguity"". Where other RolePlaying games such as Mass Effect Fable or Fallout have a clear ""Good Karma/ Bad Karma"" ""Good/Evil"" ""Paragon/Renegade"" state The Witcher lacks this and it makes it all the more challenging on a mental level. You don't simply click the 'blue text' or the 'option that has a halo glowing on it'. You have to think about it give it some foresight. Think ahead. I like that. It highlights the distortion between right and wrong and shows what The Witcher series has always shown Things aren't black and white.The quests aside from the main storyline are also extremely well written. There are a few real golden ones and as not to spoil anything I won't betray their endings because they really are beautifully written. And if you're afraid you'll run out of things to do in this game don't! Because my my. There's too much. Like really. Too damn much! I'm never going to be able to explore all of the ""Points of Interest"" on the map nor complete every contract side quest and billboard mission. I think coming to think of it this is my only issue with the game. And it's the most ""First world issue"" I've ever made there's too much! Haha and it's a good thing for some people some people can sit down for maybe 300 hours and collect every collectible and 100% the game but for me I felt as if I was obligated to complete them all and felt a little bit of a slacker if I didn't complete them all. It was only when I nearly doubled my ""Required Level"" for the main quest did I feel I might be subtracting from the challenge of the real plot and dedicated vast amounts of concentration to it.The characters are all brilliant in this game too. Old friends such as Dandelion Zoltan Triss Vesemir Eskel Lambert all make a return and there's plenty of quests you can do that include really great chemistry and dialogue between them all. The characters that make their first appearences in this game such as the much awaited Yennefer Emhyr and Ciri herself. Other smaller characters such as Vernon Roche and Ves also make a come back but did forget some characters.For one (WITCHER 2 SPOILER ALERT) ......... If you let Saskia live at the end of Witcher 2 she never returns. And is never mentioned despite her very useful ability of being able to morph into a dragon. Also Iorveth who I was pretty good friends with in The Witcher 2 completely dissapears. There's one mention of him throughout the story and it's from a NPC who speculates that he heard from someone else that he might have been shot and killed. Great. Good to know?I digress however for the rest of the characters in this game really do compensate for the lack of a few.The gameplay which comes as a bit of an afterthought for some reason is stellar. The clunky fighting mechanics from The Witcher 2 have been fixed and every sign of the god forsaken awful fighting mechanics from the first game have been completely erased the combat is fluid immersive and realistic. Like one of the loading screens says it's no button masher. You've got to learn to block to pivot to roll and maintain your stamina properly otherwise you'll faulter and most likely lose a lotta health. This is great as it means there's a nice learning curve that just about any dedicated RPG player can pick up. The skill tree is also vastly simplified but retains its nice statistical focus on numbers in combat.The exploration in the game is quite like none other. Unique scripted dialogue will appear in the most obscure caves imaginable and it makes it feel like you really can just do whatever you want and Geralt wants to too.Alchemy and Crafting is also a little simpler but I did prefer the Alchemy system of the Witcher 2 where each substance and herb was seperated into individual catagories and you could mix and match at will but this system works too.As for the aesthetics hooo leeee shiiiiiiieeet. Beautiful. I heard a quote from Adam Kovic from Machinima (at the time) state that ""Graphics only matter for the first ten minutes and then they kinda don't matter"". But I have to disagree with that. 80 hours in I arrived at Kaer Morhen again and was blown away by the realism of the forested mountain ranges. It was truly astonishing. And Projekt Red maintain that level of astonishment all the way through the game even in the bloodiest muddiest battlefields they look astoundingly good.I'll finish on a little feature most people forget The Soundtrack. It's really good. Like really really good. It's epic cinematic intense. Like I said it's really good.If you've got a PC and you want to play this game do it. But I honestly do recommend buying the first two games as well. That way you know the plot you know the characters but you can also appreciate the Witcher 3 more when juxtaposed with its ancestors. Even if you don't you'll love it anyway.You're not supposed to give things 10/10 but if IGN can give GTA V a 10 then damnit I can give this a 10.",Rocket League®,5,204,6035,1088,5

3/26/2017,0,0,339,Not Recommended,"The illusion of choice and lots of boredom.The game offers loads of weapons and items to find. There are many places to explore. You will quickly learn that most items and weapons are useless though. You will constantly visit the same areas because those places provide beat gear and you need best gear to have any chance of winning.The game ends up being repetitive and boring. Every game is the same. You can't play how you want to play. The bad weapons are so much worse than the few (maybe 4) good ones that you will completely ignore them. The player has no option to try going it with SMGs or one of the bad sniper rifles. You will die because the good weapons will kill you in as few as one shots or kill you much quicker than you can kill the enemy. Be prepared to pass up or drop supposedly uncommon weapons as they give you no chance at winning.Everything in the game screams developed and created by amateurs. It constantly crashes. The replay feature does not represent what just occurred. Hackers abound. Vehicles try to kill you and often succeed. ""Loot"" is poorly distributed around the map you can end up with two of the best weapons and no helmet or go through several buildings without finding any weapon.Only certain special streamers get private servers so prepare to play the same game over and over again. Sometimes you will play multiple consecutive games where the starting location and circles are the same. How fun!The game has improved since its release.

7/27/2018,0,0,4,Recommended,Product received for free. okay. first of all allow me to get this out of the way. i hate what bethesda did with the creation club. they essentially made modding (somthing that was universally FREE through all of normal skyrim for the most part) into a way to make money after already having to pay 40 bucks for the base game (granted you recieved it for free if you had the original and all the DLC) just to have to go and buy credits that you and only buy in set amounts with the higest being the same price as the game itself. i feel like this was bethesda just being greedy with a fan favorite that everyone knew and loved. and while yes you can still go to nexus and mod bypassing bethesdas greed it still feels like a kick to the gut for those of us that played the game since it first came out on pc and console. now for the upsides. the game is beautiful. its a surefire upgrade from the original skyrim and is an amazing game to play. and while some will enjoy the original more (i do for the simple fact my pc is and can run the original skyrim better) just going through the beginning was enough for me to be awestruck as if i was playing skyrim all over again for the very first time. the gameplay is simply amazing and sucks you in. and while this brings me to my one personal downside SSE is still a recommended game for anyone.downside is that with the updated graphics and the amazing features this game is hard on any computer that isent up to date in its hardware and software. my computer even the lowest graphics settings could run it but not without the lighting glitching all to hell and textures ing up. maybe its because my install dident finish correctly(?) but i still love this game.,The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,3,4,1710,325,3

9/25/2018,0,0,4,Not Recommended,Garbage. Like not even exaggerating in the slightest this is absolute garbage. I initially bought it to play with one of my friends but as it turns out you can't even do any of the quests together until one of you gets about halfway through the quest and watches all of the cutscenes so that someone else can join. And then once they join it turns out that the entire game is a regurgitated cycle of the same 30 minute sequence! Fight an enormously large monster for 5 minutes chase it for 1 minute rinse and repeat 5 times until you kill it skin it for material. Use this material some items to craft some gear that makes you //feel// more powerful but in actuality since the monsters are scaling directly with you does jack except make your character look like an idiot 7/10 times. I wasn't around early enough to experience any of the server issues that gave this game more than half of it's negative reviews but I WAS incredibly hyped for this game and looking forward to sink several dozen hours into it. Instead each and every second I devoted to this game felt like it was being forcibly taxed off of my life expectancy. I would rather go into a coma for two years than play this game for another two hours. everything abotu this game I wish I stopped before the two hour mark so I could get my refund from Steam.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,4,1320,247,1

Im glad I got this game for free and did not waste my hard earned dollars on it.. The cheaters have completely ruined the game for me... Not to mention the shizzy netcode and physics that is just bad bad bad.. hopefully SCUM will fill the space left by this game.. Great idea but poorly executed code has just damned it from the start..

There's a somewhat steep learning curve where you're just happy you made contact with the ball but once you get the hang of things it's very addictive. There's a large skill gap and now a bunch of different modes to play. I like that matches take less than 10 minutes (5 minute rounds plus replays goal kicks and possible overtime). I also like that the DLC is only cosmetics I haven't bought any of them and it hasn't affected the gameplay at all.I'm editing this review for the Steam Awards stuff.

8/2/2016,0,0,324,Recommended,Matchmaking system has to be improved killers and survivors have to be matched according to a short range between ranks. How is a ranked 1 killer matched against a bunch of ranked 20s survivors or vice versa fair? Survivors getting caught and intentional disconnecting resulting in a loss of points for the killers and killers disconnecting if he or she felt that the game is on a losing end for him eg. Better skilled survivors getting generators online faster than the killer could find them.When survivors searches for games in the lobby it always bugs out and players have to keep retrying to search for games and when we do we encounter killers that lags. No doubt it's a fairly new game bugs and glitches are understandable.After ranting so much I still recommend this game.Although the negative trumps over the positive but give the game a go it is still enjoyable to a extend. I will still continue playing Dead by Daylight I still see potential in this game becoming way better than it is in it's current state.Dead by Daylight is one of those games that you really hate and rant because of problems it has now but you just can't stop playing because in some sense it's really fun.Devs really has to address this common issues that majority players are having problems with.,Dead by Daylight,5,324,1283,225,5

No logs no error codes no nothing.My account name also doesn't have special characters or anything all my drivers are uptodate I don't have any exotic system setups etc. etc. . Yes all my other games run perfectly. This is simply a terrible exception handling. It has never happened to me before and I can only advise people to wait with their purchase. It happens for too many people who pre ordered and pre downloaded.

10/27/2017,0,0,256,Not Recommended,I'm doing another take on my old review here goes GTA V is really an amazing open world game with a stunning online mode and truely great DLCs BUT Take Two interractive (Rockstar's owner) does not care about the consumers anymore only about the money. Everything the devs put their heart into is hugely expensive and is virtualy impossible to obtain without spending large amounts of real money (shark cards).As a result people mod give themselves millions of GTA Dollars and go around killing people who are just trying to enjoy the game and that's not even the worst part they don't get banned you do In my case I got banned for... well I litteraly don't know they didn't even give me a reason I didn't mod recieve money from modders or grief ever on my 1000 hours on PS4 and 200 hours on PC. They gave me a 1 month ban and a character reset completely deleting my previously mentioned 143 lvl progress houses cars bunkers garages EVERYTHING! When my 1 month ban had finnished I got back in and played for 5 minutes only to recieve a permanent ban...You can't even use a friends account that was generously given to you because your Scoial Club (GTA online) account is permanently linked to your steam accout.In conclusion Story Mode is like a dog nice and funny does what you tell it to do and just keeps on suprising you with new features and mods. Online is more like a very wild yet cute cat you're very excited to play with it at first but then it starts feeling like a job you don't even get paid to do. The grinding beacomes bananas. And then it just comes in for the kill when you least expect it and now you can't play anymore because you got banned BOI. I do recommend GTA V since it's a truely great game but ONLY BUY IT FOR THE STORY MODE AND THE SINGLEPLAYER MODS they are great.Hope I could help you out! Have a great day.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,256,1838,344,1

The bad stuff nearly doesn't bother me as much as you'd think when it boils down to it. The game doesn't require additional purchases to play (not that I'm advocating a cosmetic only system in a game that costs $40 already) the textures not loading and people shooting through walls happens maybe once in 20 matches for me and you can use the buggy vehicles for some pretty dumb things.There's the feeling you get when you win as well. Maybe I just get it because I don't win a lot but it's still refreshing and exhilarating when you kill the last person and you can ride that high for the rest of the play session with your friends.That's the other point this game is WAY more fun with friends especially good friends. Finding all the attachments to tweak a gun to your preference moving through the map as a group calling out flanks and positions it's a nice feel to it.This game won't be for everyone. Some people can't look past the bad and it's fine. Some people are more suited for the faster playstyles of Fortnite or H1Z1 and that's fine but for me PUBG is great.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,520,1603,288,5

4/22/2015,0,0,543,Not Recommended,The game is astounding in all respects however the online is a mess. There is no division among servers so someone in America with a ping of 200 may be lagging around your server and that is only 'IF' you are successful in getting online. In truth the system being used is so ancient and prehistoric that you will have spent more time loading than playing the game. You want to set up a dedicated server? Load single player then load multiplayer then load a mission load the players into your mission load the mission itself and then when done load the end of the mission and load the server back up again. Usually invited players are kicked back to main menu and have to be invited again to the server. When you play online and don't enter any events or missions you die by severe lag or get disconnected.Worst of all is the t where Rockstar service is unavailable and you have no reason at all as to why you cannot connect but your friends might get online even though it says the services are unavailable. Its due to terrible online design and no literally no money spent on buying servers.If you buy this game to get online just be aware you may never actually get online and all the t methods people tell you to do in order to get on will get you no where because this is all based on the terrible service from rockstar. Again another example of a game company that milk your money and tell you to go yourself when their online service breaks down. In truth Steam should be removing this off their store as it only tarnishes their good reputation. Would love to continue playing the game but have been unable to for 2 days. Was playing perfectly fine for 3 days then this Its a disgrace. And a waste of my time and money.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,543,1726,324,1

In fact all of the actual elements of survival advertised such as ""Thirst. Hunger and cold"" Really don't matter anyway as it all takes a back seat to the PvP so as far as survival sims go its really just shoot before you get shot if your lucky enough to find a gun a fps shooter that lets you build stuff. its really the community that makes or breaks these kind of games so do not play alone because everyone is out to kill or steal your stuff while your logged off anyway. Cannot recommend because its not working as advertised this far into production better off spending your cash on a survival sim that actually works like a survival sim and not just an fps. so in Garry Newman's own words ""I wouldn't buy it"" (unless your into lots of male genitalia because you will end up seeing that ALOT both rendered in the game world and in the qualities of the people you will meet.",Rust,1,3,1185,226,1

( this will happen even if you surround him). the servers are mediocre nothing special at all. You will finish a game then spend 5 minutes trying to reconnect . loot box thing for cutsomization is almost a scam but man if you get a skirt after a few key purchases you can make a few hundered bucks on the steam store. all in all its a great game with an active community that just needs a better anti cheat and a better customization system besides getting a good loot box and having to pay 2.50 to open it. also my grammar sucks .,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,388,788,154,5

8/19/2018,0,0,86,Recommended,"(If only Steam had a ""Neutral"" option.)At the time of writing this review the PC port of MONSTER HUNTER WORLD is very flawed albeit serviceable. The implementation of Denuvo DRM is very restrictive and surprisingly taxing on many computers requiring CPUs with FMA3 instruction sets (which are only available on CPUs newer than the Minimum specs for the game itself would suggest) eating into performance not unlike Assassin's Creed Unity did on launch. Several textures are muddy and improperly ported from the console versions and are not available in their highest resolutions as supported on the PS4 Pro or Xbox One X. Several settings (whether this is intentional or not) are not available to be edited freely in the Settings menu such as motion blur (being on at all times) depth of field chromatic aberration etc. And as many people probably already know at this point *numerous* connection issues making online play very erratic and inconsistent. In addition performance optimization is spotty at best making it hard to achieve 1080/60fps in the neighborhood of the recommended specs.Not all is bad however and Monster Hunter World still allows for a considerable deal of video and audio customization and the modding community is fairly active. As for the game itself Capcom has done a fantastic job. Gameplay is very tight and stays true to previous games while offering a fair amount of new gameplay mechanics and opportunities for the player including the slinger gadget. Multiplayer when it does work is very satisfying and provides an insane number of possibilities for co op play. Every single monster has its own unique behavior patterns and characteristics with a rather sophisticated (though at times questionable) AI encaptured within a living breathing ecosystem ensuring that no two encounters are ever quite the same.The reward system in this game is very cyclic but that's to be expected for a Monster Hunter Game you kill monsters to craft gear to fight stronger monsters to craft better gear to craft better gear to fight stronger monsters to craft better gear ad infinitium until you eventually have the best armor and weapons in the game. World's endgame is a bit improved compared to previous entries giving you more options and customization in how you want to chisel out your builds although you are going to have to work for it. The endgame is a steady grind but all the while you're constantly getting stronger via stat gains and personal skill.I wouldn't consider myself a Monster Hunter ""veteran"" (only really played Monster Hunter Tri and 3 Ultimate and played a very small amount of Freedom Unite) but I do say that Capcom did a very good job with this entry. Just a shame that the initial PC release had to be marred with so many issues. For that I can't wholeheartedly say that I truly ""recommend"" this game on Steam for the time being unless you can solider on through the issues but do get a chance to play this game sometime be it later when the price drops and/or when the bugs and probelms eventually get patched or play it on consoles.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,86,3078,522,3

9/1/2017,0,0,255,Not Recommended,"almost 200 hours on record (not as much as many byt stull decent). I will be reviewing both the Online and Offline expirience.(Online)Majority of this has been playing GTA Online and I still have hardly progressed. I own a good apartment and thats it. If you are looking into buying this game for its online its too late you will join as a new player and either get kicked from the lobby for being too low rank and no one wanting to play or if its a race you wont win because you dont have a good car you dont have a good car because you dont have money which you wont get much of if you dont win. Forget about all the Online additions like Bunkers Airstrips and insurgents etc. you wont ever gain enough money to buy them and if you do spend all you money you had saved (Like i did) on a bunker not only will rockstar release a much better DLC for the online later but you wont actually be able to do anything in your bunker unless you have an extra million lying around. Not only are the items in game overpriced (online) but the shark cards also are so if you plan to say ""screw this grinding"" you cant buy shark cards without cutting off you own arm. So overall the online is a hectic mess thats if it even works in which case you will have to play offline.(Offline / single player)So most people (like me) will buy this game for the mess that is the online play. But you will come across your computer not being able to connect to servers for no reason every now and then leaving you to play the offline. I have been playing the offline single player for quite some time (2 days over the weekend literally doing nothing but playing the single player) for the fun of it. It must be said the campaign is amazing interesting funny exiting and overall and enjoyable experience that is of course until the game start to glitch out for god knows what reason leaving you no choice but to close the game of which you cant even go to your house to save the game because of how rampant the glitches are with roads disappearing and of course this game decided to turn auto save off for whatever reason and left me unable to turn it back on making me loose all my progress in the single player game and thus me finishing the weekend with no progress whatsoever.(Overall)Overall GTA V is fun exiting and enjoyable but only if you have a beastly computer and a miracle of an internet connection at all times and god help you if your game just decides to hell with it and just glitches / breaks / crashes for no reason what so ever. Leaving you to wait through the minutes long loading screen as you boot the game up questioning if your progress has been saved or if you have been banned for leaving online during a mission. Only to find that exact thing happening to you (note i have not been banned off online yet nut right now i am just sick and tired of pouring hours into this game and still have bugger all in online and only be past the Prologue in single player)",Grand Theft Auto V,1,255,2960,566,1

11/17/2017,1,1,626,Not Recommended,Frankly this game is a complete waste of time. I got into it from watching some youtube videos about it. Seemed challenging. Building + Shooter. It is a really cool concept for a game. Unfortunately there is a tremendous amount of grinding involved to get anything(8 16 hours for basic tools weapons and a tiny base/room which will be raided and looted as soon as you log off) and all progress is lost in mere seconds. After 40 hours you may have a chance to use decent armor or even a good gun at which point you will turn a corner and instantly die and lose everything. The good guns are way too overpowered and everything else is just garbage. The game consists of two types of players The 14 year olds with 2000+ hours invested who run around in groups and instantly kill and steal and noobs who have nothing because they keep getting griefed by the 14 year olds. I've never played a game this grindy with zero sense of satisfaction. Maybe It's because I'm not an and I don't like to grief people. Take my advice and spend your time elsewhere. I only wish I had realized this sooner and I would be getting a refund.,Rust,1,626,1119,209,1

The singleplayer on the otherhand is handsdown one of the most fun and engaging experinces this generation. They really did a marverlous job in that department. If only Rockstar actually cared about singleplayer and expanded it with additional content more than the online. Not only did they do more for the online the singleplayer content in the base game is all your going to get. Online is the go to because that's how they are going to make the most money with the microtransactions. I would say wait until a sale just because of the shady and downright disrespectful practices Rockstar had begun to lean towards.

I hate to even call your DLC anything less than their own great games Undead Nightmare is still in my top ten games of all time. But with Shark Cards it's sad to see that you guys are treating DLC the same way everyone else is lowering the bar you have set for so many years. Buy more money so you can have this wacky hat and op gun. Isn't that what gaming is all about? I have a lot of problems with how GTA's story was treated from the reduced ammount of activities to do in the world all so you can play as three bland characters with only one having a complete arc by the end but this just shows how little you care about producing good SP content. By not even allowing the community to step in and fufill the role you have shunned by focusing on just the impressive but lacking MP you just show how little you care about creating the Singleplayer experiences you used to craft.

5/25/2016,0,0,19,Recommended,I have always wanted to play this game...When I got it I instantly regretted it. No friendly people at all. Even if you go on a friendly server. It's KOS (Kill On Sight) for all servers. I do like this game but at the same time I dislike it. I cannot even build a 4x4 base without it getting it raided by a$$holes. 99.8% of people in this game are ignorant a holes and it makes a living hell playing this game. I go on for a bit and come stray't back of. It's really hard to rate this game because I dont like disliking games or giving it a low rating because I know the devs work really hard on this.Pros Outstanding building mechinesim. Really good graphics (For a unity game) Really nice gameplay.Cons most of the people are absoloute a$$holes Everyone is Kill On Sight Really hard gameplay (Die very easiley of hunger e.g) And the list goes on for a while....I guess I could rate 5/10 (Overall) 9/10 (Gameplay) 0/10 (Easy) 0/10 (On a good community on every server) I do like this game. But I kinda don't at the same time.,Rust,3,19,1026,195,3

The graphics are amazing the customisation is fun but the best part is that the game just works and doesnt try to be something it isn't. Hopefully more game modes come out down the track but at the moment it's well worth the $20 base price tag.P.s.

1/7/2019,0,0,81,Recommended,I'm just gonna throw out some random points. Some are facts some are opinions. Take this with a grain of salt.1. The game has a relatively easy to follow story.2. The Handler is the dullest character in the entire game. Seriously random NPCs have more development than her. 3. The amount of starting weapons is very daunting. From personal experience don't start hammer if want to have a good time. Hammer is powerful but not beginner friendly.4. Fighting reminds me of Dark Souls.5. Eating is essential if you want to be successful.6. Game looks great. Other than the opening scene the game is perfectly playable on 1080p High with a GTX 970. Average 45 60 frames depending on whats going on around me. Never drops below 40.7. Controller is almost required. Keyboard and Mouse are usuable but the game wasn't made for them. Use a controller here for the same reason you would use a controller in Dark Souls.8. The learning curve can get steep. Might need a guide.9. Don't hit your teammates with your weapon unless you want a taste of what the original Xbox Live lobbies were like.10. Anjanath will always one shot you the first time you face him. He has broken hitboxes. Good luck.11. The moment you get to high rank a monster known as the B 52 Bomber shows up randomly in your quests. You'll know what I mean when you get there.12. Deviljho and B 52 Bomber hate each other. They will fight. When they fight get the popcorn and wait a while.Good game.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,81,1453,260,3

6/15/2017,0,0,151,Not Recommended,I got this game on launch and while the singleplayer is very fun the multiplayer is complete and utter garbage. Without even considering Take2's recent takedown of a major modding tool for the game I can not recommend this product as its goal is to suck as much money out of its customers as it can. $10 will get you GTA$500 000 (in game currency). This isn't enough to buy half the supercars let alone any airplanes rocket powered cars or yachts. This would all be okay if you could try out these vehicles in singleplayer but sadly that isn't an option. Rather Rockstar would have you spend real life money for a car or a apartment that you MIGHT like. If you don't like it then you can sell it for less than you bought it effectively wasting money. All of this and I haven't mentioned the hackers that plague the multiplayer and all in all make it an unfun mess of a mode that aims to take your money.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,151,903,171,1

5/4/2017,0,0,218,Recommended,"The game is great and has alot of good things going for it. It clearly draws inspiration from DayZ and H1Z1 and that's perfectly fine because they pull off the ideas behind the games with few bugs or glitches that are gamebreaking (Looking at you H1Z1 flashbang). But it really isn't flawless in any sense of the word.For starters lag is a huge issue in the game. The difference between client side and server side can at some points be absolutely massive and make the difference between getting a kill and dying in what should have been an easy skirmish. Second the load times for the game aren't stellar. Yes it's a huge map and yes there's alot of detail. But you'd think that after sitting in a lobby for a minute sometimes longer and then in a plane for at least another 20 seconds that there wouldn't be the issue of ""Ghost structures"" and unrendered textures. I'd be perfectly happy with potato textures and somewhat decent sounds for the first minute or so after I hit the ground if it meant I'd be able to see all the buildings from the start.Third Going back to the lag issue client to server communication is certainly an issue. One prime example of this is when I was trying to kill someone who was bathroom camping with an AKM while I had the semi auto shotgun. Despite unloading five rounds into the center of their chest and having time to be halfway reloaded only one of the shells actually registered as a hit resulting in my death.So yeah of course the game is ing fun. I never tilt off of a death which is something incredibly common for me to do in most games and the fact that the only thing holding you back from winning the game is skill (And unlucky frying pan bullet blocks) it's a stellar game especially for one in Early Access. Don't view this as a list of things I hate it's just a list of blemishes on an otherwise amazing game and I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes the TPS/Survival/Battle royale genre.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,218,1947,359,5

9/11/2018,0,0,417,Not Recommended,Man I love this game just look at the numbers as I'm writing this I've capped over 200 hours on it and I wouldn't be surprised to go over 300 in a few weeks. But you know what I won't recommend this game because of 2 major problems 1. This game is really poorly optimized if you aren't in the 1% players that's got that big 2500$ pc you ain't gonna run this game smoothly and it sucks A LOT. Most of us are forced to set everything in low so that we don't go under 30 fps when monsters/hunters are performing certain moves. The dev team better move their to optimize this game as they previously promised to the pc community.2. There's really no end game content the only thing you can do is to grind jewels and augments and that's it (and for what purpose?). The only thing I could come up with is to grind materials to make a top tier build &gt to make speedruns but that's it really there's no reason to grind for Attack Jewels or whatever if you ain't gonna speedrun and as a reminder speedruners aren't the majority of the playerbase.This game really is awesome and all I really felt in love with the series but they clearly messed up the pc version and I ain't gonna support that.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,417,1186,227,1

8/11/2017,0,0,101,Not Recommended,I played this game a while back before it turned into a pvp f kfest. It's leaned away from the building and creative aspects of a survival game and turned into a multiplayer fps. I don't like dealing with people (they usually would rather just kill you and take your inventory rather than negotiate and trade) so this game has lost it's appeal. If you enjoy games like PUBG this may be enjoyable for you but it's lost its appeal to me.,Rust,1,101,435,82,1

The worst part is is that if you took out the worst aspect of this game then there'd be no point. The people the community of people who play on these servers are pure evil. If you don't start playing on a wipe day or group with people you will be griefed bullied and harassed to no end. There are 12 year old kids screaming racial obscenities this is sad.

It isn't worth the money and I doubt it ever will be. A 4th Gen i7 and RX480 should be able to run current realeases at least on medium with no stutter/input lag (hint 99% still do!). The most recent patches seem to have made things go from hardly tolerable to much worse. All evidence of a company with too much money behind their briches and no idea what they are doing. Also the Unreal Engine is at least 40% to blame for this trainwreck.

It OPENS A CRUCIAL PANEL.THAT is how batshit insane this port is.The game is great. But don't buy it on PC. Buy it on console and play it with a controller because that is honestly the only system the devs of this game understand how to even use. I think they used an xbox one or a PS4 controller to program the game because nobody who is familiar with a keyboard or more than two solitary PC games would design controls like this.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,192,854,157,1

12/26/2015,0,0,769,Recommended,"Rust is an AMAZING game and if you have a really good PC then I highly recommend you purchase it. It is one of the best 3D multiplayer survival games. There are a lot of items you can play around with and you can design your own base however you want. The graphics are clear and crisp and the combat is intense. You can see the bright tracers light people up in the air. The gun sounds are realistic and loud. They are also balanced in recoil damage and range. A problem with the game is that on a lot of servers there are huge clans that I call ""Server Monopolies"" which basically dominate the server by taking over smaller groups and individual's. It is easy to get raided by them and you would have to be online a lot to keep track of your base. Other than that Rust is a great highly competitive game and I recommend you play with friends in a group because it is hard to survive solo on large servers.",Rust,5,769,906,176,5

But that's only like the car bugs and the ones where you fall through the ground. It gives the game character lol. That being said picking up the same weapon 4 times until it registers is annoying. Single player is kind of dull if you aren't good at the game. I finally have gotten somewhat decent and can hold my own but when I first started it was miserable dying to people that were super good in less than a week of the game being available. Close combat sucks. Shotguns are unpredictable. SMG's are less so but still. They need to fix how much skill you need for close combat. Need more clothes please. I know we just got abunch for gamescom but still not varied enough.Pros The game is a total blast with friends. The thrill of never knowing what might happen gives every match anticipation. My hands shake sometimes when I am on the verge of winning a tough match. Few games make my heart race like this. Strong map. I love how varied and big the map is. It's really fun to drive through the countryside pull over to check buildings to find another team and blast your way through them. The equipment. I like how the guns are varied enough that it just is exciting to find your gun. Every time I find a SCAR L SKS or Mini 14 I get real excited. I am obsessed with getting the attachments I need for them. I once got a fully fleshed out M4 and made my friend spew his drink when I said ""You may be an M4 but you've got a sweet little "" The visuals are pretty good when maxed out. Graphics aren't so high end that I lag or lose frame rate but they are high enough that I enjoy what I see. Good balance of function and form. THE LONG RANGE GUNPLAY IS ING ROCK SOLID. I love taking a shot with a Kar 98k and seeing the bullet zip through the sky and diving straight into someone's skull. It's truly a satisfying feeling. Vehicles Not entirely bad not entirely great. But it's pretty fun ramping off hills in motorcycles and doing flips or crashing through people in the UAZ. Buggies are good. I think Dacia's need some work though.Overall the game has flaws but its strengths stand out. I suggest playing this game with friends but play alone to learn and hone your skills. This game has tons of replay value and is overall good if you realize it is early access. Anyone who complains about the servers lag or other similar flaws before release doesn't really have a right to until 1.0 release. They are just being entitled.SCORE 9/10",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,287,3067,582,5

Also some items like plastic explosive are very rare and even though you can learn how to craft them the materials for them are still rare and you need 2 plastic explosives to blast a single metal door....... this means if you make lots of doors and split resources in different rooms it will make it a nightmare for people to steal and if others do it it will be expensive for you to steal ...even after all this i still like the game and since it's still in alpha things might get better,Rust,3,28,917,171,3

10/5/2018,0,0,261,Not Recommended,The single player story was fun. GTA online is a scam. It costs over $1.2 Billion in game currency to purchase everything the online edition has to offer. At USD$99.99 for $8 Million in game it would cost about USD$14 998.50 in micro transactions to buy everything. Without spending money the grind to obtain even a decent chunk of the items is unimaginable. Hackers run rampant and pretty much suffer no penalties. I've never seen a video game with such an insane amount of sketchy websites dedicated to scamming players out of money and their steam accounts. If you are fan of GTA you have probably already played this game. If you are looking for a fun game to play... trust me... move along.

EVERYONE INVOLVED SHOULD DIE IN A FIRE!I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS GAME UNLESS YOU USE MODS First I have to say that on its own its hard to recommend this game. The single player while fun is just too over the top and is a huge step down from the incredible story we were a part of in 4. The multiplayer is a mess with the heart of the problem lying in a slimy pay2win system because making over 1 billion in sales just wasnt enough... There are several more reasons I think rockstar absolutely failed with this mp but I dont want to write a book. With those nagging nitpicks out fo the way the world itself is incredible. Now a sandbox on its own isn't enough make a game fun. However with mods namely LSPDFR this becomes one of the greatest most infinitely fun games I think I've ever played and I'm a huge fan of games that dont ""end"". For instance ArmA series or Mount and Blade Elder Scrolls series etc. I'll admit the process to mod this game for lspdfr is tedious and somewhat challenging but it is ultimately worth it. Ripping around Las santos responding to gang violence pulling hummer drivers over chasing a meth head through the mountians.... Crime is fun but this game almost feels like it was intended to become a police sim. So theres my lspdfr fanboy 2 centsSo in conclusion I'd give the BASE game a 4/10 for SP feeling like a d list action script and MP being a pay2win rip off of PAYDAY.As a platform for mods however I give them 9.5/10 only losing points for seemingly going out of their way to make the game dificult to mod.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,349,1741,325,1

3/31/2017,0,0,264,Recommended,PUBG is a very fun game that gives players heart pounding moments. There are however some very big issues that the game needs to fix (I know the game is still in early access so hush child).The game is mostly well designed. The gunplay the intense moments and the duos/squads is all done very well. There are however three things that in my opinion really ruin the game sometimes. 1) The poor optimizationThe optimization of the PUBG has gotten much better since the launch. There really isn't much to say regarding this. I would suggest asking people with the graphics card that you have and see how they run the game before you buy it. The game was and still might be more heavy on the CPU. If you're in larger cities of the game and starts lagging it can take away your ability to fight and aim properly to eliminate other players. This can be annoying. 2) The serversThe PUBG servers are pretty bad. In the lobbies it can be very frustrating to not be able to see who and who isn't in your squad or the lobby UI not working and having to refresh it many times or losing connection midway throught the game. This can be annoying. (Side note They did add the feature to rejoin the game if you crash which is great) 3) RNG (Loot and Safe Zone)RNG in the game will have a major impact on if you win or lose the game. The loot on the map has chances to have better loot in certain areas (Military Powerplant etc..) this is not my problem with the game. You can go into several houses at a time and not find a single gun and another person can walk into another house with end game loot and curb stomp you. The next problem is the safe zone. If you're in top ten and you don't get a safe zone spot with no cover you will more likely have a more difficult time winning the game. These things are annoying.TL DRHas problems but very fun to play with friends.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,264,1854,353,5
1/22/2018,0,0,81,Not Recommended,"Not recommended mainly because 1. Very unoptimized game makes your frames drop even on low settings. The team is getting there optimizing it but the whole game probably would need a rework to get the maximum optimization.2. Laggy hitboxes will make you go ""I LITERALLY SHOULD'VE SHOT HIM ALREADY""3. Incredibly boring mostly just looting and there's little to no combat anywhere and when there is it's usually ends up becoming problem 2.4. I know the developers are doing their best to get rid of hackers but this game is a hell even with 1 hacker. This isn't one of the games where you simply respawn and continue progress.

6/1/2016,2,1,26,Not Recommended,i kinda feel that the only thing that was really improved other than the graphics was the sleeze. It 's like because of all the refrence by comedians and youtubers how cool and funny it is to sleep with hookers and then kill them in gta games. Rockstar said hey lets give the public what they want and make all the characters as sleezy and lowclass as possible. One of the missions have you video tape people having sex while hiding in the bushes. Another mission your having sex with a herein . It 's just to prevelant and it seems like way too many missions your doing garbage like that. Yea the graphics are great the cars and guns are great but I just wanna do the stuff i can 't do in real life like blow stuff up and shoot cops. I like all the previous gta titles way better. There is really nothing new and innovative being done with this gta title. This game reminds me of a will ferrel or adam sandler movie. The first couple were good when especially when your young and stupid. After this many releases of the same with moderately increasing lewdness on every title I find myself realizing that rockstar games and I have nothing in common and won 't be spending anymore time and money on them.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,26,1204,227,1

3/31/2018,0,0,362,Recommended,This game used to awesome. It was a nice place away from all the little kids who play Fortnite and the community was pretty cool (aside from the occasional talking and loud pregame lobbies).This game is going downhill fast though. It started with the introduction of loot crates. You used to just earn the loot crate with in game curreny/purchase and then open it immediately. Then they slowly replaced each loot box behind a pay wall. Then they introduced weapon skins you could buy and sell on the community market. Now they have released an Event Pass which is unbelievably similar to Fortnite's Battle Pass with the tier progression unlocking a different mainly cosmetic reward.The game itself is still fun but if Blue Balls keeps adding this crap in it's just gonna be another royale game in the shadow of Fortnite.Edit This game has gotten a tad better with the introduction of a new map but the microtransactions still need to be halted.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,362,944,163,5

6/27/2018,0,0,60,Recommended,"The premise of PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS is similar to the hunger games. You parachute in from a plane before scavenging for supplies while constantly being pushed to a smaller and smaller zone by an incomming ""storm"". Game focuses on making things like map and weapons realistic unlike some other very *similar* game. While the graphics of this game are amazing I believe that many of the players don't get to experience it because of the crappy performance this game provides. While it will still run on medium specs pcs it a no for lower specs pcs beacuse this game bottlenecks literally everything. It's a multiplayer game with no story that gives you the freedom to approach your problem how you want or to solve an incomming problem that is comming straight at you. Only until recently there havent been any dlcs or a ranking system to this game. With that situation in the past it's weird how people stayed loyal and kept coming back to this game. Now there is a season pass available for purchase which gives you a ranking system and a way to unlock cosmetics. Free users get a change to unlock *SOME* of these rewards on *CERTAIN* levels of the pass with a great slowdown in progress of levels. Gameplay wise you get an option to choose between first person mode or perhaps a third person mode in which first person mode is still available. Gameplay includes standard long range fights or perhaps if you prefer something mid range or close range that is available as well. Game utilises the usage of vehicles to get around its huge and detailed map. All in all if you can ignore the problems of this game like some bugs and a medium amount of cheaters the game at the current price is worth also it's worth mentioning that the event pass is not expensive and it is easily affordable.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,60,1796,319,3

Conversations doesnt seem to be completely skippable when NPC's keeps telling you the same stuff when you just wanna craft something.3. Some keys needing abit of rebind and i cant seem to rebind target lock which is the F key. Too close to D which moves you to the right. Keep hitting F sometimes and gets f'ed up by suddenly bieng locked onto the mob and unable to turn away for a few seconds.Besides all of this i find it really really fun and the game feels really really good.And if you are worried about the always online thingy. Yes you make sessions. But you can make it private and passworded and then you are never bothered by anyone.Also if your connection drops or anything it just goes to offline mode.

8/3/2017,0,0,296,Recommended,"(I KNOW THAT THIS IS AN EARLY ACCESS GAME AND THAT THERE IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE GAME AS IT DEVELOPS BUT THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN THAT HAVEN'T BEEN FIXED FOR A LONG WHILE) There are few things that I really want to cover in this review first off the developer's decisions for the game. The developers have added a lot of cools things in the game that are fun and interactive but some of those things have not been full tweaked yet so they can actually work properly for the players such as motorbikes these vehicles have been pretty broken and although they are said to be ""fixed"" are not completely fixed transitioning onto certain terrain will cause the motorbike to just completely flip over without a hill or a bump which can be devastating and rather frustrating while trying to play the game. Second off there is always a problem with the game after an update once they update their game there is always an unecessary amount of screen tearing and frame drop making the game unplayable and what's the point of buying/playing a game that you can't even run despite having the ""System Requirements"" for it. Finally they implemented the crate and key interaction in the game which they claimed for it to be necessary before the launch of the game which this may be true that they must test it first they should be more focused on making the game more playable before they worry about adding cosmetics into the game and they should implement it of the test servers first allowing people to have interaction with the crates and keys without having to spend their money on them first before actually trying them out on the real game it just seems rather unecessary for the developers to think that they ""need"" to do something like this on the actual game rather on their test servers first which is the whole point of the test servers to TEST their additions to the game.May I add I really do like this game and want it to be successful but it's hard not to try to say anything when there are just so many unecessary things being added to the game before it is actually out and released.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,296,2123,390,1

8/12/2018,0,0,35,Recommended,"Overall great game but the large amount of issues with the control scheme makes many things annoying.First of all I choose keyboard and mouse because i find it easer to play with even though I wanted to play with a controller. Menu navigation is very tedious on both controller and keyborad but having a mouse is a bit helpful.Game cursor and camera are just badly emulated control sticks so both will only move at set max speed.There's no click and drag or simple ""holding shift to unstack"" and ""hold ctrl to move the whole stack"" when managing the storage and inventory instead to take out an item from a storage you press ""1""(god why). If you want to put an item from the inventory into the storage press ""2"". So okay you're ready to go and want to quit out of the storage menu but to do that you have to press RMB because pressing ESC will take you to the loadout menu and pressing it again will allow you to change a name of the current loadout.The biggest issuse I would like to adress is the keyboard control scheme where one key is bound to 3 4 functions. Ex. Attack unsheath weapon interaction and jumping from vines all bound to LMB.Sprint stealth mode dodge and more mobile attack moves bound to space. Sometimes you want to attack but you will roll instead.This is understable on a controller but not on a keyboard. I feel like Capcom is trying to handicap keyboard and mouse players so it's evenly difficult on both devices.Combat is a much more complicated topic to just simple say it's better with a controller or with a keyboard and mouse because of the variety of different playstyles each weapon offers.Simple sword and shield playes well on both of the devices but then there's the Kinsect Glave.Most of the combat consists of bouncing off enemies and steereing a small bug trying to hit certain body parts.Playing on controller is just impossible. With ""camera lock"" on the camera is all over the place while airborn and above an enemy. With it off it's even worse since it's absurd to constantly adjust the camare and keeping a combo going. This is where a mouse has a huge advantage.There's no proper hotbar. Currently if you want to use an item bound to a number key you have to press F1 F4 and then a number key. You have to press an F key each time you want to bring up the hotbar. You can also you the scroll wheel to cycle through held items but it shows all usable items in your bag so it takes a while to find someting you're looking for.Multiplayer is broken random disconnections while with other players in a group and the game is swithcing to offilne mode often",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,35,2594,473,3

Gameplay is good though input seems a bit laggy but the graphics and performance are stellar (for me at least).Sure there are some bugs here and there but none of them detract from the heart pounding experience you'll have every match which is amplified knowing that there's no respawning. Nothing is more rewarding then standing atop the 99 corpses of the other players in your match. Truly this game is a test of patience tactics multi tasking and communication.Can't wait for future updates.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,162,543,90,4

1/21/2019,0,0,500,Recommended,Rocket League is fun to play since the beginning but getting better increases the joy to play it even more. Being able to hit the ball precisely on the ground or up in the air allows you to combine skill with creativity to score incredible goals. Getting there will take you a few hundreds of hours tho. On the way you can look forward to score amazing goals every now and then by pressing buttons in panic and maneuvering the ball into your or the enemy teams goal without any understanding how you've even hit it. These goals as other situations usually come with a burst of preprogrammed sarcastic Messages trying to hit you hard but mostly make you wipe a tear of joy. When your team is a few goals behind it pays off to keep a cool head and lead your team to victory.. or blame your teammates for being noobs as you gaze on the scoreboard to see you being MVP of your team with solid 10 points ahead and ragequit as soon as the enemy team shoots the next ball into your undefended net. Thanks to the fact that most players steer via controller and don't have a keyboard in range the community is much less salty than League of Legends. I love this game.,Rocket League®,5,500,1158,219,5

11/25/2017,0,0,1,Not Recommended,Maybe 7 Days to Die just raised my expectations for all other survival games too high for my reviews to be fair but I'm reviewing anyway.Rust feels like 7 Days to Die but without zombies (obviously). It's rather boring to play alone or with a small group of friends and on larger servers it's hard to do anything without getting killed immediately upon spawning. So the options are playing privately or on an empty ish server or playing on a large server and getting killed upon spawning. The first option is boring as there are really no threats to your survival to make a serious challenge and the second option just sucks for new players trying to join a server.Once again I compare this survival game to 7 Days to Die which is challenging thanks to the zombies and day 7 hordes and other game mechanics.,Rust,1,1,807,146,1

8/10/2018,0,0,98,Recommended,A great game flawed by some release quirks.Let's get these things out of the way first No ultrawide support ( There's no way to disable motion blur as of writing this Mouse movement currently feels like there's mouse acceleration/smoothing. It's not that it's worse it's a system that tries to emulate an analog stick. Public servers are dying during peak hours due to massive waves of people getting off work/classes for the weekend.Why is this getting a thumbs up then? Because I'm still having fun and I have the darndest feeling that 3 of the 4 issues will be fixed in a patch or resolved on their end. In addition I've found that hosting a private session has fixed the disconnect issues for me and my friends. The game runs at a fantastic 60 FPS on 1440p at highest settings with a GTX 1080 after updating drivers. Game will run 4k at 60 FPS if volumetric fog is turned down.If you're into Monster Hunter Games or think that a third person action rpg with a focus on boss fights is interesting I suggest picking it up. I strongly recommend playing with friends in these first few days as most people are still focusing on leveling up and are not responding to SOS calls as a result.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,98,1188,216,3

6/16/2017,1,2,164,Not Recommended,If you're considering buying this game don't. This game has become a prime example of late stage capitalism in it's finest. With the game being split into it's two halves one being the singleplayer campaign and the other the ****ing atrocious 'GTA Online' microtransaction hell hole GTA V has fallen into a horrific pit of comapnies trying to take advantage of their fanbase and users. If you've somehow not heard of the recent OpenIV news about Take Two bull**** attack on the entire PC modding community then I highly reccomend watching this explanation by Daniel Hardcastle on Youtube down below...https //www.youtube.com/watch?v 0gKlBIPR_okIf you still want to enjoy the singleplayer experience regardless of this attack then just pick the game up second hand.

4/28/2015,0,0,345,Recommended,An astoundingly vast game a worthy successor to GTA IV. The key difference between IV and V manifests itself in the life present in the city the life present in the characters you encounter on the street in missions and the ones you control. The story is not a narrative masterpiece but the voice acting and linework is with negligible and miniscule exceptions that do not even linger long enough to recall /fantastic/. Rockstar have outdone themselves through incorporating the fierce combat style of Max Payne 3 alongside the atmosphere of Red Dead Redemption in conjunction with a new and improved stellar produced and programmed piece of GTA history.To truly appreciate the monumental leap from IV to V I implore anyone interested to boot up their IV copy and enjoy an hour or two of gameplay immerse yourself as much as possible. Then return to V and you will immediately be met with a feeling of Rockstar having had the time to the skill to and the unabridged interest in delivering what they could not do but wanted to in 2008 alongside seven additional years of creativity.If this is what they can do /now/ I dare not guess what they might be able to do in the future.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,345,1176,208,5

Anyone can play this game and will have fun regardless of age and skill level. The DLC is purely cosmetic so there is no pay to win.There are a variety of game modes to play and so far the producers don't seem to take them away after a few weeks like in league of legends. The cross play between PS4 and PC creates a bigger scene around the game.The frequency of updates is not too fast nor too slow.The new steam workshop support adds an immense amount of undiscovered potential.There is no pressure to win unless you want to be competitive.

1/2/2017,0,0,5,Not Recommended,Not even worth the $13 I paid for it. Everytime I've tried to play I get disconnected right as I'm about to build my shelter and I lose everything. I also find the maps to be very overpopulated. It would be nice not to spawn in an area that is covered in other people's shelters. I was only attacked by other players a couple of times and then they healed me I'm assuming it's because I'm a girl so anyone who does like the game and isn't disconnected all the time should consider using a girl's name if they want to avoid being killed repeatedly. Oh and it's ridiculous that I'm chasing a pig with a rock and the bugger can run through all boulders and structures to avoid me.

3/31/2018,0,0,160,Recommended,I sorta like playing and it has the ability to keep me coming back but I cant count the amount of times I land and find nothing but junk laying everywhere. Ill find a micro uzi stock in 5 houses in a row. Ill find pants hats flashbangs and ammo until my 5th 6th house which is a very common scenerio and finally get an M16. And when u do find guns oplenty its shotguns and pistols. Do they work? yes are they effective? if you can survive long enough to empty your 45 into them or have time between pumps of the shotgun yes. Now finally when I have a game where I find the scar or M4 75% of the time I find my self the farthest possible distance away from the circle which means I have to take one of pubg's loud and dreadful vehicals which I absolutly hate for the fact you can hear them from a mile away and no matter how defensive and evasive i drive 50% of the time Pvt. Jackson is there to snipe me in the face. You will find your self being assassinated by Seal Team 6 frequently too they just pop up on your and take you down . The game requires both skill but more so then anything else... Luck. so the last thing I should mention is you spend about 15 to 20 min in game and get maybe 20 seconds of action. Thats if you didnt croak early which is common pending on a variety of scenarios which alot of are not in your control.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,160,1334,269,4

Lots of people are saying bad servers I havent had ANY trouble with servers could just be people who dont connect to thier region on the lobby screen.I hope the game continues improving such as the vaulting system thats coming up aswell as the future maps.

6/6/2017,0,0,396,Recommended,Extremely simple and straightforward game yet with a seemingly unending layer of depth and complexity.When you start playing this game you're going to miss the ball and miss easy saves. 10 hours later you will be hitting the ball much more consistently and starting to score more goals. Soon you'll start telling yourself Hey I'm getting pretty good at this game! This is only when you realize you've only scratched the surface of Rocket League.As you start getting better at hitting the ball towards the net you will realize the opponents will start to get better at blocking the shot. You need to get more creative with your shots juke the opponent out dribble the ball ontop of your car go for an extremely crazy arial shot. Learning these things and perfecting your technique takes countless hours of practice.Rocket League is one hell of an experience. It is an amazing game that you can start having fun in right from the beginning. This game will make you eager for more because you will want to get better and improve your skills. You will become better and better just by dropping hours of enjoyment into this game and that's what makes it great.

11/23/2017,0,0,1299,Not Recommended,One of my favourite games of all time and i would recommend this to people who dont intend to put much time into it. Trying to get good at this game is an absolute how. At higher ranks wins and losses make a huge difference and all to often the game wont be decided by who played the best but instead by which team got the troll/toxic player. The higher the ranks the more of these people there are (especially the really really toxic ones). You'd think that like in most other games these ppl would be banned or get some other penalty. Yeaah guess what Psyonix still makes money from these players and they can't see how this effects the other players at all apparently. Right now Diamond and Champion ranks (and probably GC too) are just a test of who has got the most patience who can sit through entire games of being flamed or having teammates ing you up on purpose without letting it affect your next game.If Psyonix would care just a bit about this issue i would be fully positive and i would probably play this game full time. Right now i can play 4 5 games in a row before i want to kill someone. Fun times.,Rocket League®,1,1299,1116,213,1

I think for winning you should get 2 crates or something so you are actually rewarded. After a while the game does get boring because theres not much variety like Fortnite the devs add new game modes like the new teams of 20 but in Pubg you can only do solo duos or squads unless you go into custom games in which there zombies and teams of 10 for example. Another good way that the devs could make the game more interesting is by adding actual game modes like StoneMountain64 does like shotguns and crossbows only which would give people to play the game again.Before i stopped playing there was asian hackers everywhere me and my friend would get low then started getting headshot by a kar98k without fail after dying we went and watched the replay to see the player locking on to players through objects and shooting them ruining our experience because there's nothing you can do at all.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,235,1127,207,1

12/28/2016,0,0,409,Not Recommended,"I would like to tell you that in my opinion do now R and how they are ruining the game forcing you to cheat or just farming forgetting that this is a game. A game designed for fun.Think back those who play at least a year. As before in another we were treated to the game and preference for fun entertainment rather than simply farming money. But the developers themselves shout at us ""You can not make money to buy the wheelbarrow So buy a payment card which is worth more than the game itself and you will be a lot of money for which you can buy a pair of useless wheelbarrows!"". But you do not like this situation. You look out digging in the internet and find cheats or some glitches with the money. You do not leave a choice.Let's just go on site with cheap cars and look at the price tags. And what do we see? Motorcycles. One is 2kk. Near the old pimped which should cost no more than 15k. And the motorcycles the value of which goes far beyond 100k. Even ordinary scooters sell for 50k.Now let's see what the prices were before. We flip through and see that the cars of the recent upgrades are very expensive. Conventional muscle cars in livery standing at 300k or more. The lower we go down the cheaper and dearer cars we see. Some are the same as new without labels. The same f*cking Dominator is a 10 ed * times cheaper! R so lazy that sell old cars in a new wrapper.Take a look at the old motorcycles. Do not believe it? According 12 15k. Of course Hakuchou monster is 82k but that it justified the price. His counterpart in the new store flaunts for 1kk. Well yes sometimes kings arrange discounts so we certainly have bought that .Look at the new supercar. The average price tag for 1 5 2kk. But they still need to pump. Previously the most expensive was the Adder's wheelbarrow and all surpriced wali saw him in the free session. The remaining cars cost about 500k not to mention sports cars.And yet we can say that new cars disgusting quality. Their bottoms do not have detailed covering all the bl * dskim sheet glare as a 3D object without textures. All of the same type. The more expensive the steeper. Now the only way determine the best wheelbarrow.Before it was different. Sporti classic loved and went to her constantly. How often do you see people today on sport classic? Yes if only on this new Tornado which place a landfill. It is sad to see how developers are in the pursuit of money.Now some of you shout ""What about updating Bikers and Import / Export A Cool new job is to transport cargo and earn money!?!""Yeah cool. Enter the game as a job. Jerk off with warehouses and businesses. Wait until you call black and say that the whole warehouse cleaned some s pumps. A guard bought for 500k just sucked. A warehouse? You all week for half a day filled the largest store in order to sell. But R cut off the faucet with a single session and you had to take back the goods to the public. Once you have boarded the ship or aircraft immediately flew the boys and smashed everything to smithereens earning a couple of thousand dollars and ruined you. You're broken capillaries downloads cheats money and then a couple of hours you get banned for a month and you take your cheat 10kk and another couple earned an honest living. You start yelling and leaving maynkraft play because there is no more strength.And you know what they were doing in the game before? We were playing the usual race shootout. Did you know about this regime as a confrontation? The mission of ""corrupt cop"" where the two teams had to send a case to different places. How fun it was to go from the cops and other people's teams while you were covered by his own guys. ""Rapid convoy"" ""Hasta la Vista"" and other exciting modes. We no longer go there because it is important to get as much money and experience and the fact is interesting or not we are hammering. That is admitted. How long have you tried to stop the cars in ""Swift convoy?"" A land and hold a position with the ""landing""? This is a relatively new confrontation but many do not know of their existence. And who would like to play in them waiting for half an hour at least one person.But what next? People dream of new maps and some dizzying updates where everything will be cool and have to really fly on airplanes to get from Liberty City to San Fierro. But we have a small town and a soulless desert scolding sadness and melancholy yet you go on an empty highway thinking about what iam doing here...",Grand Theft Auto V,1,409,4460,830,1

Yes PUBG has bugs yes PUBG is more unstable but the game is being worked on and is a good game already!Stop with your excuses of getting killed by a cheater cause the chances of that happening are very slim to none some people are just very good at the game (Watch Shroud on Twitch). Also the better your computer the better you will be I play on a Laptop and that does definitely affect my performance!

6/6/2017,3,408,17,Recommended,"First of all we need to establish what Cold Waters is and more importantly what it is not.Cold Waters is a remake of the 1980's Microprose game Red Storm Rising based on the Tom Clancy novel of the same name. It's a submarine game set in a ""Cold War gone hot"" scenario.It is *not* Dangerous Waters or any of the other Sonalysts submarine sims. Nor is it meant to be. The different crew stations are not represented.Cold Waters places you in the role of the submarine commander *not* the sonar operator *not* the weapons officer nor does it put you working out TMA and firing solutions. The UI is a basic 2D map showing your submarine and other contacts. The contacts shown are based on the best solution available given the sensors in use. If you are just using passive sonar the solution won't be great until you've taken the time to build up a good solution by changing course and letting the AI classify the contact and work out its speed. You can help out the AI by selecting a contact as your active contact (i.e. telling it to focus more on building a solution for that contact) and by manually cycling through the narrowband signatures and selecting the one you think it is. If you're right the solution will firm up faster than if you just let the AI do it. If you're wrong the solution will take longer and be less accurate. If you head up to periscope depth and visually mark a surface contact the classification and firing solution will be pretty much spot on straight away. If you just use your ESM mast you'll get a bearing only solution. You can use your radar mast but the Soviets will pick up your radar transmissions and at a much greater range than you'll get a return. Oh yeah your periscope... has a basic ESM indicator to give you an idea if Vasiliy in the Tu 95 has just picked up your periscope on his radar.Navigating the sub is by WASD to set speed rudder and dive plane angles and you can also adjust the ballast tanks. It's not great but hopefully the developers will add a function to allow the user to set course depth and speed directly (like in Dangerous Waters and Silent Hunter). The current controls are not ideal but they are workable and in my opinion are better when taking evasive action to dodge torpedoes.Weapons are fairly straightforward and very easy to get to grips with if you are a sub sim fan. Torpedoes can be set to active or passive you can set them to run shallow normal or deep you can set the direction of the search pattern and give them a waypoint when to go active. Wire guidance is simulated so you can steer the torpedo or change its depth activate it... as long as the wire is intact. Yes it models wire breakage.Harpoons and TASMs are pretty simple. You can set the waypoint you want them to start searching for a radar target. You can set narrow or wide radar search pattern. You can also set them for a sea skimming or pop up terminal profile. The Soviets will really let rip with their CIWS so don't expect a lone UGM 84 to do much against a Kirov.The sonar model seems to be quite in depth most of the reviewers here criticising it are doing so because they haven't read the manual don't see a waterfall display and think ""Muh arcade game"". Killerfish have modelled sonar performance and environmental effects it's just the AI interprets it all and presents you with its interpretation on the 2D display instead of having the user mark contacts on the broadband waterfall classify them on the narrowband and work out turns per knot etc. Acoustic layers convergence zones surface ducts... it's all there. Killerfish actually said in the game previews they were putting a lot of effort into the sonar/environmental modelling. Lots of people are asking about the towed array. Apparently it *is* modelled but you can't stream or retrieve it manually and you can't actually see it in the 3D graphics.Yes cavitation is modelled and yes you can create a knuckle to spoof a torpedo. You can rig for silent running and this means you can't reload weapons. Torpedoes can jam in the tube if you try to launch them at high speeds rendering the tube unservicable until you return to port.Damage control is of course very simplified. You just tell the repair party what to fix. The manual does say that flooding gets harder to deal with the deeper you are and I've noticed if your submarine is flooding it does effect the bouyancy and you need to blow ballast or use the dive planes to compensate.Playable subs are all the USN SSNs from the Skipjack through to the Los Angeles class. All your favourite old Soviet subs and surface units are there Alfas Deltas Novembers Victors diesels like the Whiskey and Tango the SSGNs like the Charlie and Oscar. Surface units are fairly comprehensive too including Karas Udaloys Moskvas Kirovs etc. Aerial units include Bears and Helix (I think there are Mays too but I haven't seen any yet).The AI seems to take pretty sensible torpedo evasion manoeuvres and uses noisemakers. Once the Soviets have located your sub they pretty much spam torpedoes depth charges and rockets at you so things get pretty interesting.Two campaigns included both are dynamic one set in 1984 and one set in 1967. The campaign map is pretty much straight out of the 1988 game. You ""drive"" your sub around the map where you will see enemy surface and sub surface contacts as they are detected by satellite maritime patrol aircraft or SOSUS (contrary to what another review here says SOSUS is present and modelled in the campaign map). Bear in mind the Soviets also have satellites and maritime patrol aircraft if they detect you then they will vector ASW assets to your location. You can drive around at normal speed which is deep 25 knots. This will mean your sonar performance is degraded you are easier to detect and once you make contact you're likely to be much closer to the enemy. You can drive around at slower speed shallow 10 knots which gives you a better detection range and you will start engagements further from the enemy. This isn't so great when you're chasing down a surface group though. Finally you can sit still on the map shallow at 5 knots have the best detection range and start the engagement at the longest range. Note that there doesn't appear to be any NATO units in the game so you never see friendly units only Soviets and maybe some biologicals. Campaign missions I've had so far are stuff like intercepting Soviet SSKs inserting special forces behind NATO lines inserting SEALs behind Soviet lines intercepting amphibious task groups intercepting diesel or cruise missile submarine wolf packs interdicting submarine replenishment tenders. There will be other Soviet units going about their business on the campaign map and you could very well run into these. The campaign is semi dynamic fail missions and the Soviets win WW3 do well and NATO wins. The campaign is pretty brutal. You will die a lot.As far as technical problems go I've come across a couple. I've had the game freeze on me after I abandoned ship was rescued and assigned to another sub. I've had another campaign mission where I sank a Victor but it didn't ""die"" and was sitting there immobile on the bottom but I couldn't exit the mission because the game still thought there were enemy vessels nearby (I'm pretty sure there wasn't).The developers have said they are considering adding period British and French submarines for the player to control as well. Swiftsure anyone?If you want a ""new"" Dangerous Waters then this is not it. This is not a Sonalysts submarine simulator. If you buy Cold Waters expecting it to be all broadband waterfall displays and TMA calculations then you're going to be disappointed. If you want a submarine *command* simulator set in the Cold War or you remember the fantastic old Microprose classic and want a modern remake that is incredibly faithful to the original then Cold Waters comes highly recommended.",Cold Waters,5,17,7905,1394,3

8/11/2018,0,0,17,Not Recommended,"Multiplayer is so INCREDIBLY BAD! Prepare for hours of frustration as you try to progress through the main missions. For no reason you have to play through on single player until you see a cutscene. People say you can SOS flare at that point but that has never worked you have to leave and restart the mission to play co op. You have to do this on pretty much every main mission.Outside of the storyline it's a little better but not much. Disconnects that aren't actually internet related are common apparently for everyone. That gets really frustrating during a long fight.It's also difficult to get into the same group together as there is a complete lack of a party system. Each level you queue for is referred to as a party but once it's over you split up. The game is popular right now so everything fills up immediately.And if all of that wasn't bad enough if you get disconnected from a game (which is never internet related!) you can't rejoin it because your spot is filled with a message that says ""Player left the game"". Rather than reserve that spot for you to rejoin it blocks YOU (but not others) from taking the slot.Consoles apparently had a squad system but they pulled that for steam groups I guess but there's no features for that aside from showing your steam group icon by your name.The multiplayer in this game was designed by someone who has never played an online game in their LIFE.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,17,1406,253,1

11/3/2018,0,0,154,Recommended,"Solid recommendation. I ""finished"" it after 120 hours with two classes of weapons basically fully farmed for so you can probably beeline through the game in about 60 hours if you just want to finish it. Why ""finish""? Well with every weapon being feasible you have massive replayability and variety when you are ""done"" you then unlock the tempered versions for even harder challenges and better gear there are events etc etc. Overall you prablby can get a solid 300 hours out of this game without it being just ""pure grinding"".So what's not so good about it? The disconnection issues have been mostly addressed it still happens twice a week or so but that's not a big deal The controls are pretty whack if you compare it to something like Dark Souls. I can't count the number of times the game didn't recognize my input or just ignored the second pressed button that would start a combo and just i.e. block instead of heavy attack. Now if you then press the button again it still doesn't get it. You have to fully release all buttons and then do the combo again for it to recognize it. Happens ALL the time just annoying. Also the few things that get stored like Bow dashes are horribly implemented as the store a random dash direction and ignore where you are pointing when the dash actually executes. So yeah the controls could be so much better. You won't be unable to finish the game because of this but you will miss a lot of combos and timings because of this. Just annoying nothing game breaking. This is NOT a true PC version this is just a controller mapped mouse and keyboard input meaning dragging the mouse is fixed speed just like on a controller stick. They made some fixes to it in the last update that might have addressed that but I recommend just like with Dark Souls to use a controller anyway. Unless you are using the ranged weapons then a mouse might be better for aiming as the monsters move quite a lot. Your character is just a dumb lifeless shell. Doesn't talk doesn't ever change his/her facial expression.... just WTF..... Only about 20% of the game is actually voice acted at least in English. Would have been great if they made everything fully voiced because the voices that are in it are great!Overall solid buy recommendation for the full price.",MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,4,154,2277,409,4

If you are worried that it is a bad port due to some arsehats review bombing the game I wouldn't be PWeek 1 Update Played far too much this week P Having heaps of fun only real annoyance has been the occasional disconnect during multi player. I did some research and added some port forwards to my router as well as laucnh options that seem to have helped maintain a more stable connection. You wouldn't know if from the forums but it has been a pretty smooth launch week IMHO PWeek 2 Update I love the emergent gameplay when you are hutning one monster and a whole bunch of monsters start fighting each other right on top of you! It can be sheer bloody chaos P Still getting disconnected in co op a couple of times a night not in love with that issue hopefully a fix gets released soon. It is very hit and miss! I ran one session with 16 people for 3 hours other times I DC 5 minutes into an investigation.Week 3 Update Patch has fixed Co op disconnection issues. Had a really fun weekend even when we ""failed"" a few quests we still had a hoot. Have not had once DC all weekend in way too many hours of playing DBloody hell it's been a month update P Launch week was a bit of a rollercoaster (complete with some screaming and projectile vomiting).

4/14/2015,10,45,83,Not Recommended,"Another rock solid RockStar release .. requires Social Club to play crashes almost immediately on launch .. yeap .. glad I paid for this Update The launch of this game was appalling huge amounts of different causes for crashes and different bugs causing e.g. incredibly sluggish FPS on default settings. The apparently needed mobile app still doesn't support PC a couple of days after launch.The only official answer I've heard is that if you use anything but a z A Z and 0 9 in your user account name they suggest you create a new user account which is ridiculous in itself. Some of the other causes for crashes have been solved by the community and e.g. on reddit you can find a decent list of suggestions. However there still seem to be a lot of people for whom none of the suggested solutions work.I finally managed to get myself into the game the crashes at launch seemed to have been caused by .. my microphone. Disconnecting my Blue Yeti before launch got the game to launch and I could reconnect it once I was in the menu without it causing the game to crash again.After managing to get into the game the gameplay turned out to be very good much more fun than I hoped for but still leaves room for improvement on the controls side.The controls are incredibly complicated pretty much every key on the keyboard has some function assigned to it and the ""hints"" for using them are briefly flashed at the top left corner the first time you need it thus it's easy to also miss it and get stuck trying to look for what key is for e.g. going into cover.While the game has a lot of promise I cannot with good conscience recommend this to anyone until they fix their .. this might take a month it might never happen.

Online is pretty good too I hear but with my mods which I can't disable without reinstalling the game I can't play online. That's fine. I understand that it would be extremely unfair to have overpowered gods running around fair players. Something that I don't like though is the fact that there is a ton of exclusive content only for online that means that because I decided to mod the game and not go online with hacks exclusive clothing and masks are withheld from me which kind of sucks. Still though it's a good game which I am currently redownloading so I can play online (for the first time!) meaning that my internet is nothing for a day.

2/2/2018,0,0,26,Recommended,this game is great fun however I have reserved myself to being happy with a top 10 position instead of top 3 or actually winning a round heres why........ every round i have played on has hackers in it there is ALWAYS some fat kid sitting in his bedroom with god knows what hacks activated where all he has to do is spin in a circle and he destroys anything no aiming just holds the trigger down and gets headshot after headshot this is a HUGE ISSUE that needs to be erradicated asap the player base in this game is HUGE but the fact that literally every game has at least 3 5 hackers in it pretty much make winnig a round impossible. I do enjoy this game and play both solo and with my friends and i will continue to play in the hopes thaat the issue above is somehow fixed with a decent anti cheat system which could BAN the fools with hacks on........now a message to thoes who hack ...... Why do you ruin this game for everyone else? why use hacks on a game that actually requires little skill to get near the end of the round? are you that thick that you cant even play the game you have to use noob hacks to make yourself feel good ? i feel ashamed for you i really do i have to tell you something little hacking children the fact that you win a round with your hacks active DOES NOT make you a beast or good at the game or a boss player.... IT MAKES YOU A FRUIT A NAPPY HEADED FREAK ! your literally scum LITERALLY !!!! you should actually go ahead and sell your rig as you CLEARLY dont know the 1st thing about gaming whatsoever. i bet most of you are sitting there now with mountain dew in front of you and a big bag of cheetoes open fatties I hate everthing you hackers are about and I hate the fact you all think your great at games when in actual fact you AINT your really not good at all go play some cs go and leave the decent games to people like me who actually play and use tactics to get as far as i can. your CANCER virgins with cancer the lot of you. you make a show of the gaming community and you should feel ashamed if you wanna use cheats do it on single player games not on multiplayer games your ruining the fun for others just to make your fat self feel good,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,26,2185,435,3

People say the community is terrible I love the real nature it brings out in people. Everyone is a savage at heart their loss is your gain. Fighting with sticks and rocks for precious resources hours spent defending what you've spent so long to gather from outsiders and crushing defeat when you realise you've lost days of gathering resources and playtime to some group of preteens who found and exploited a weakness in your base. I've spent a ridiculous number of hours on this game learning to survive solo against impossble odds and if you're not WEAK you will too.

12/22/2018,0,0,1,Recommended,In regards to modding single player Modding this game is a real chore for some mods. I have been experienced in modding for a while Fallout Skyrim DoW half life you name it. But damn nothing could prepare me for how complicated it was to simply add a custom made mod car to the single player. The program you have to use the way you have to change your files was so overwhealming i just couldn't do it.I ended up refunding the game because through tryign to install like 3 mods i went down such a rabbit hole undoing all of the mods i had put in place would have been an absolute nightmare. Meaning I couldn't play online or I whould surely be banned. So unless you have the patience of a monk you're going to have a bad time modding maybe not so much if you are patient and you get the hang of it and know where everything is/goes. Not to say the mods for this game are bad the custom cars weapons and scripts rival the made my proffesional game companies.This is just my experience with modding. Yours can be diffrent it just depends oon how far you're willing to take your mods.The base game is pretty good I played it for a while on xbox and then on PS4 and I remeber enjoying it very much. The online was a mixed bag on one side there a lot of stuff to get and you want to get it/experience it all. But on the other hand it an absoulte grind to get even some median stuff. Unless of course you're willing to shell out mad cash on shark cards. Anyway overall i'd give GTA 5 a 7/10.,Grand Theft Auto V,3,1,1485,291,3

In a game supposed to be a 4player Co Op romp Players have had to see same cutscenes to be able to play together Its 2018? Or is it 1990? That horrendous lip sync Totally breaks the immersionIf the server issues arent fixed asap this game and all its Co Op Multiplayer monster hunting charm will fade away in a month.

1/8/2018,0,0,95,Not Recommended,Ok I finally broke down and got this game because friends playing it. Thank Jebus I only paid 20 bucks for this single player marvel and complete multiplayer hack fest trash. First the main issue... 1.) The developers do NOTHING to stop people from hacking the game2.) It completely stops you from just playing with your friends. every damn mission the game forces you to join public or throws some random joe into your misson. It FORCES you to join public servers and deal with those hackers in order to do ANYTHING with your buisnesses.3.) It only supports MODS in single player. There are some AMAZING MODS for this game like the graphics overhaul mods that are only on your end and in no way affect the game for ANYONE ONE ELSE that are straight up not allowed into online because of rockstars BS controling how you play the game. So in reality the is NO MOD SUPPORT FOR THIS GAME!!!!4.) the SUPER BASIC concept of alowing players to create their own PUBLIC SERVERS allow who they want in their PUBLIC servers and have the ability to browse PUBLIC servers that are online has aparently escaped rock star. THIS alone would have made this game amazing and would have completely looked over the other glaring issues because they really wouldn't be an issue....THIS would eliminate 90% of this ing games problems.5.) STOP AUTO CORRECTING MY HELI FLIGHT AND ALLOW FOR MOUSE AXIS PITCH CONTROL!!!So overall impression of this game. If your looking for an AMAZING singleplayer game that is deep and entraling in it's execution and has SP Mod support... This game is an absolute must...If your looking for a multiplayer even close to most other games basic functionality and options for multiplayer....

It didn't dissapoint me at all.However I'm giving a negative review because of the ""Second"" gamemode GTA online.The idea is cool. It's just like the old SAMP or MTA (From GTA San Andreas) used to be with a lot of new stuff new missions etc.EDIT Fun fact MTA/SAMP's connection was so much better than GTA online's.But I just can't enjoy it. This gamemode has way too many issues with connection. I get problems 7/10 times I try to join a friend and get randomly kicked to empty rooms.No it is not my internet speed. I have 40MB and can download up to 4MB/s. I can play any game without a single issue. I tried to enjoy it I tried to look at the good side but there were just too many issues and problems connecting that I give up.Plus you get to spend the 15% of your time playing (depending on how much you play. In my case it's the 60%) watching the loading screen which by the way is a MUST for anything. Finished a mission? Loading. Wanna join a friend? Loading. Gonna switch between multiplayer and singleplayer?

Then when your in the final two having just scored a perfect headshot with your silenced VSS from half a mile away without even being spotted the other last guy will come behind you armorless and naked and while you whip around in a fat fingered panic accidently chugging an energy drink and throwing a smoke grenade when you meant to pull out your silenced UMP with a holographic sight and foregrip he will beat you to death with a frying pan your blood splaying across his exposed chest and thighs while Smash Mouth blares out of his mic.

The reason for the lack of players is because well..Facepunch decided to majorly overhaul Rust with an experimental build. While the older version (which can still be played) got left to rot.Here we are a year later. There's the Legacy version (Rust 1.0) and then there's just Rust. Which is the majorly overhauled version. There's a procedarily generated map waaaaayyyyy better graphics and the game runs smoother. Now if you haven't touched Rust since Legacy then there will be a huge learning curve for you. It's literally a whole new game but it's still a ton of fun to play. (I'll add more at some point in time but the final verdict will remain a 9/10),Rust,3,75,812,146,1
6/15/2017,0,0,161,Not Recommended,Grand Theft Auto of course is a great game that I have always enjoyed. First got it on PS4 and really loved it but started to get bored by the vanilla content. Also seeing users on youtube playing it with mods really made me decide to put some extra money into the game to get it on PC. Now if you haven't heard recently Take Two has decided to get rid of Open IV which is the foundation of lots of these GTA V mods. The only reason I bought this game on PC was to mod. I don't play online and I don't plan to. Them getting rid of Open IV will just stop me from playing this game. Give me long enough and it will be a distant memory that I couldn't give two about. I no longer support this game and I will NEVER reccomend this game or any other Take Two games. Thank you Steam for your time.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,161,791,162,1

1/3/2014,0,0,165,Recommended,I've played this game a lot over the 2013 winter holidays. As of writing this the game is still in an early Alpha build. Rust is an addicting game. There's a constant urge to gather/craft/horde resources to further progress your place in the world. Servers are persistent. Your base and all of its belonging are subject to raids 24/7. It s the closest thing to a PvP oriented Sandbox MMO since EVE A difficult comparison to draw considering Rust is an FPS game and not an MMO. However server can be as large as a few hundred simultaneous players and the player structures are persistent so in that sense Rust accomplishes the same feeling without actually being an MMO.Conditions are harsh. Just surviving the environment can be a difficult task and the first few hours of gameplay will be spent just learning to stave off hunger the cold and natural predators. Survival quickly shifts to the political nature of your neighbors. Do you trust no one and hope the rest of the world overlooks you? Or will you align yourself with a group for mutual protection? There is no right or wrong way to play. The choices you make very much impact the server you live on. The content in this game is purely from the interaction of players. In that regard the game is fully playable and enjoyable even in Alpha. Having said that there is much more to look forward to as the game evolves to extend depth in every mechanic that drives the gameplay. Improvements to gathering crafting maintaining items building defending researching I can only see this game getting even better over time.,Rust,4,165,1573,277,1

Letting you be some from freaking Iron Man to role play as a cop or add the vechicle's they put in to multiplayer knowing they'd have more people pouring money into it to get the stuff. Because to get ANYTHING in GTA Online is either 1. A massive grind which only leads to more grinding or 2. just a pit of shark cards haha. I'm not saying the Online is completely crap with some mates on the small game modes or even doing the missions as an MC or heists Super fun but no mission gives you enough money to do anything. I just think removing the mod the single mod that lets the communtiy enjoy gta the way they want is just bad its simply because they want more money.

Negative review for treating PC fans as second class citizens.I will probably go on to play a few hundred more hours of this game because it's good despite the disgraceful treatment of fans.Update Forget what I said about playing the game for hundreds of hours this installation of MH has less content than MHTri. There's hardly any hunts! I regret purchasing the game strongly.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,2,82,848,141,2

10/20/2018,0,0,290,Recommended,https //alsgamingstuff.blogspot.com/2018/08/monster hunter world pc review.htmlMonster Hunter World isn't called Monster Hunter 5 but it's totally Monster Hunter 5. It's also kind of a reboot for the series. MHW feels like a game that takes into account the things most people ask themselves when they first play MH such as Why is the map an item taking space in my bag? and Why is the quest rewards window on a timer? . MHW gets rid of a lot of the stupid stuff that has carried over from game to game for no good reason besides it being how it has always been done. A lot of things have changed but at its core this is still very much the same style of game.For the uninitiated Monster Hunter is a game about hunting monsters of course. But seriously Monster Hunter is a game about boss fights and loot. It s about learning bosses attack patterns preparing for fights and reaping the rewards when you beat the bosses. Bosses don t drop weapons and pieces of armor like in Diablo or WoW though. You get monster parts from carving their corpses and then you craft your gear from those parts. This might sound gruesome but there is very little gore in the game. The game has a light hearted comedic style to it and is no more violent than something like Zelda. There is a story tying everything together but it is not much more than an excuse to lead you into new areas and introduce new monsters to kill.Compared to Monster Hunter Generations Monster Hunter World controls much more fluidly but if you re looking for a Monster Hunter game that controls as smoothly as Devil May Cry you ll be sorely disappointed. This is still that kind of clunky complex animation priority heavy Monster Hunter. There have been a few key improvements that make the game feel much better to play though. The biggest ones being the weapon sheathing and item using systems. You automatically sheathe your weapon when you start running now so you can get away from a monster more quickly. You also don t have to stop running to use an item anymore so you don t have to stand there and go through a long drinking animation and risk getting hit again. These might sound like small things but they re huge improvements and make the game play much better.The biggest change to the game is in the hunting itself though. In previous games you had to carry paintballs around run around an area to find the monsters and throw the paintballs at the monsters to track them. Every zone was also separated by a loading screen which could slow the game down a lot depending on the system you were playing on. These were things some people defended as if the game wouldn t be Monster Hunter if they changed them but they ve changed them and the game is better for it. There are no paintballs in MHW. You don t have to carry anything craft anything or throw anything at the monsters to track them. In MHW you find monster footprints hair and scales and track monsters by scent like a dog. Their scents are visually represented by the scoutflies. The scoutflies are swarms of firefly looking bugs that lead you in the right direction and even highlight gatherable items like mushrooms herbs and more monster tracks. You gain experience tracking each monster as you collect more of their tracks and eventually you ll automatically start tracking a monster without having to find their tracks. You can also put a pin on anything on the map and have the scoutlies guide you to it. It doesn t even have to be a monster. You can have them guide you to a mining node if you want.Zone loading screens are completely gone in MHW. Monsters still run away into other zones each zone is still numbered on the map and monsters are still kind of tethered to one zone at a time there just aren t loading screens. Each level feels like a big open world but it's really not much different from how it was in the old games it's just bigger and faster. The core monster tracking and chasing game is still the same.Monster Hunter World is also really good at slowly introducing you to the game's mechanics and explaining things through tutorials and tooltips. The amount of info thrown at you in the beginning of the game is pretty overwhelming even for a MH veteran but you can always go back and read all of these tutorials again because the game saves them all for you. The game also keeps a detailed notebook full of monster weaknesses weak points and even loot tables. You can pull all of this stuff up any time you want too. Tooltips on rare monster parts even tell you what you have to do to get them. There's a small Wiki's worth of information built right into the game.Monster Hunter World introduces a ton of other improvements as well. You can now go to any area and freely explore hunt or farm herbs and mushrooms without taking some useless voucher turn in quest. Crafting has been greatly simplified. You don't need recipe books required materials have been reduced and the game even gives you the option to automatically craft any item when you get the required materials. You only get one Palico and they don't have talent trees anymore. All you need to worry about is their gear. You have access to food and your bank at the starting camp in every map so you can rebuff if you die change your armor and weapon and even store and restock items in the middle of a quest. You don't need to carry honey to make more Mega Potions anymore just fast travel back to camp and restock. Did I mention you can fast travel? You can open up your map and travel to any campsite you've discovered. Items like the whetstone bug net BBQ spit and fishing pole get their own dedicated inventory slots and the whetstone has infinite uses. There are no mining picks and you never put anything you carve from a monster in your bags so you have a lot more free bag space now. It also makes it so you never have to discard an item to loot a monster part again. There's too many things for me to list here but they all add up and make the game much more intuitive.Multiplayer on PC has been pretty iffy so far. A patch that fixes some of the network issues has been released now but online was a mess during the first week and a half after launch. It wasn t just when playing multiplayer either. Since you have to make online sessions when you start a game I would get huge lag spikes and disconnect messages even when playing alone. It got to the point where I would just start the game in Steam s offline mode to avoid these issues. There are still some problems especially during peak hours but the online is working much better now.Monster Hunter World has some beautiful graphics but it's the art direction that really makes them shine. Environments in MHW look natural and tell a story of their own. The way each zone blends into the next is seamless and makes sense. For example the desert area has a river going through the Western part of the map. The river starts at a waterfall in the North and ends in a muddy lake in the Southernmost section of the map where the mudskipper monster Yuratodus hangs out. There's tall grass around the river and cacti deep in the desert. The trails going from the river to the desert look like they were eroded by streams flowing down to the river like maybe this area floods sometime during the year or maybe the swamp covered more of the desert at one point.The game looks great but technically it s kind of a mess. Some issues have been alleviated with a recent patch but others remain. The most noticeable issue is the low resolution textures. For whatever reason the game doesn't load the high res textures even though they are installed on your computer. Modders have gotten them to load with mods so we know they re there. There are also major issues with one of the Elder Dragons Teostra and the last map Elder s Recess. This map has a bunch of lava smoke heat wave effects and a ton of sh,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,290,7878,1447,5

1/30/2018,0,0,801,Recommended,This game might be glitchy but the glitches are what make it funny. PUBG was hacker paradise but more hack makers have been brought to justice in PUBG than any other game because of the devs of PUBG helped the Police to aprehend them and now this game is almost hacker free. The performance isnt the best but not even Valve could do better with CS GO even though Valve have made more than 3 Counter Strikes so why do people dislike that PUBG doesnt run well its this companies first massive game. The servers are full all the time is something i heard alot well yes they are full cause everyone enjoys playing PUBG they have a safe capacity of 1 Million players and yet can have 3 Million concurrent players as their record!!!So what do I think well this game could have been made better sure but no other game devs have been able to have the same graphics and performance without increasing ping. Plus just for a second consider how big the maps are in PUBG so sure game devs have worked around this problem but the problem with the way they did is that it made that you couldnt see someone in a building from far cause they only load in when you get close enough it upps performance but lowers graphics plus makes camping in a building so much more op.Thx for reading hope you enjoy your decision I know I do,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,801,1310,247,5

If somebody doesn't help you you're in for a hard start to the game avoiding all people with guns trying to get resources without getting shot. Sure there are bears and wolves but though your biggest help is other humans your worst enemy is humans as well. This game is for very hardcore players and that is what I like about it. WARNING I do NOT recommend getting this game if you have an older computer. It is a great game don't get me wrong but it is VERY resource demanding and will run at around 10 fps on the lowest graphics for bad computers.

My only negative comment originates from the community on the few servers I've experienced. Again nothing with the game itself just the population. It's been a while since I've been in a public gaming environment. I see racial slurs deragatory comments and failed attempts to be funny/shocking because they know how to type 'n****r' in chat still lives on strong. Yes welcome back to the Internet I understand.

6/2/2017,0,0,722,Recommended,Battlegrounds has the potential to grow into a true masterpiece of multiplayer gaming. It perfectly balances the feel of its gameplay between stretches of quiet downtime and moments of incredibly high adrenaline and intensity. Every match tells a story and every win feels like a huge accomplishment. The gunplay feels fantastic with heavy recoil shot leading and bullet drop so nailing a sniper headshot is extremely satisfying. The game looks pretty nice but hopefully graphics and optimization may improve over time right now framerates aren't great. The sound engine is fantastically immersive with sounds changing in their sharpness and tonality depending on direction and distance allowing you to pinpoint where shots or cars are coming from. There are even 3D sound effects for bullets whizzing past your character a really nice touch for an early alpha game. The whole package looks really promising right now and I hope the developers continue to make it even better. Right now it scores 86/100.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,722,1004,161,5

11/23/2016,0,0,2761,Not Recommended,"This game took and still takes up a large portion of what could otherwise be called my life. 10/10 would put my real life relationships to the test again.edit June 2017 So I have mixed feelings about what Take2 did in terms of getting rid of mods but regardless I HAVE to overturn my review to negative because I could not in good conscience recommend anyone still buy this game and start from scratch let alone for the price it still has. I'm not saying I would've recommended that anyone take on cheater money to be able to afford stuff in the game before the update but it seems like now not only will people not be able to mod the game offline anymore (which I find atrocious but it doesn't hurt me as an online player very much) new players will (as of now) be expected to pay full price for the game and be met with a plethora of content that they wouldn't be able to afford even if they doubled up their initial expenses by going for the largest shark card option. 8 million get you nowhere in this game and with the latest update Rockstar once again ensured that the moneymaking possibilities will be slow enough that even if GTA Online was free to play (which of course it isn't) at this point it would basically be pay to win (especially for new players) because there's weapon modifications in the game now that give you a major advantage but they take either a huge amount of money (think 4mil) and lots of time to acquire or a humongous amount of money (think 14mil) and lots of clicking on a button.Of course the intention of introducing explosive bullets as a legit part of the game was to take away the huge advantage fighter jets had in the past but besides all the other new weapon improvements this also means it's now very easy for someone who has played this game a bunch to grief players who are just trying to make money which they HAVE to do in public sessions where you are thrown together with others.To reiterate I think the main thing that kept people coming back to the online portion of the game especially after an update was that it was relatively easy to get some illegitimate money to be able to afford the new stuff. Of course that's not in the interest of Rockstar and Take2 to give these ""free"" DLCs out for free. But to crack down on the entirety of the modding community which for the most part hasn't even been about modding GTA Online is like I said atrocious. Rockstar took over 2 years to continually fail at making GTA Online for PC cheater proof. Others can do it but all they could do was send their lawyers and corporate powers after everyone who played a major role in enabling others to modify GTA V (! GTA Online). And even if mods do come back eventually which wouldn't surprise me the argument still remains that GTA Online has been pruposely turned into and kept a money grind which you can only legally ""overcome"" by throwing even more money down the throats of Take2 and Rockstar.Since I assume that hardly anyone would still buy this game for the vanilla offline portion of the game as I said I cannot in good conscience still recommend anyone buy this game anymore.edit November 2018 I barely play this game anymore. I check out major updates once in a while but the overall impression is that this game's online economy barring cheats has always been and will always be broken because obviously those DLCs cost money to be created by the developer. So why would they give them away for free? Yet you have the opportunity to grind your way to enough money to afford stuff and they charge you an extraordinary amount of hard earned money for a few million of in game money that you can't do much with because everything's ludicrously expensive. If that weren't the case or if you got more from such a purchase maybe I would've considered it myself once as well but this way I don't really see much reason to spend more of my time in this what's arguably still the best open world game to date period.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,2761,3956,730,1

12/2/2016,0,0,1865,Recommended,"Rocket League is a vehicular soccer video game developed and published by Psyonix. The game was first released for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 4 in July 2015 with ports for Xbox One macOS Linux and Nintendo Switch being released later on. In June 2016 505 Games began distributing a physical retail version for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One with Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment taking over those duties by the end of 2017.Described as ""soccer but with rocket powered cars"" Rocket League has one to four players assigned to each of the two teams using rocket powered vehicles to hit a ball into their opponent's goal and score points over the course of a match. The game includes single player and multiplayer modes which can be played both locally and online including cross platform play between the PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows versions as well as cross play between Xbox One Switch and Windows versions. Later updates for the game enabled the ability to modify core rules and added new game modes including ones based on ice hockey and basketball.Rocket League is a sequel to Psyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars a 2008 video game for the PlayStation 3. Battle Cars received mixed reviews and was not a major success but gained a loyal fan base. Psyonix continued to support themselves through contract development work for other studios while looking to develop a sequel. Psyonix began formal development of Rocket League around 2013 refining the gameplay from Battle Cars to address criticism and fan input. Psyonix also recognized their lack of marketing from Battle Cars and engaged in both social media and promotions including offering the title as a free download for PlayStation Plus members on release to market the game.Rocket League was praised for its gameplay improvements over Battle Cars as well as its graphics and overall presentation although some criticism was directed towards the game's physics engine. The game earned a number of industry awards and saw over six million sales and 40 million players by the beginning of 2018. Rocket League has also been adopted as an eSport with professional players participating through ESL and Major League Gaming along with Psyonix hosting their own competitions through the Rocket League Championship Series (RLCS).Rocket League's gameplay is largely the same as that of its predecessor Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars. Players control a rocket powered car and use it to hit a ball that is much larger than the cars towards the other team's goal area to score goals in a way that resembles a soccer game with elements reminiscent of a demolition derby. Players' cars have the ability to jump to hit the ball while in mid air. The players can also pick up a speed boost by passing their cars over marked spaces on the field enabling them to quickly cross the field use the added momentum to hit the ball or ram into another player's car to destroy it in the latter case the destroyed car respawns moments later. A player may also use a boost when in the air to propel themselves forward in flight allowing players to hit the ball in the air. Players can also perform quick dodges causing their car to do a short jump and spin in a given direction which can be used to nudge the ball or gain positioning advantage over the other team. 3 Matches are typically five minutes long with a sudden death overtime if the game is tied at that point. Matches can be played from between one on one up to four on four players as well as casual and ranked. Rocket League also includes a competitive ranked online mode where players compete in various tiered ranks within game seasons with victories or losses raising or lowering a player's rank respectively. The game includes a single player ""season"" mode with the player competing with computer controlled players. An update in December 2016 introduced ""Custom Training"" sequences that can be created by players and shared with others on the same platform players are able to specify the ball's path and the presence and skill of opponents on the field as to practice specific shots on goal over and over.A few months after it was released Psyonix released an update that adds game modes known as ""mutators"" modifying some aspects of gameplay such as increased or decreased gravity ball size ball speed and bounciness. For the 2015 holiday season another update replaced mutator matches with an ice hockey inspired mode (called ""Snow Day"") played on an ice rink and the ball replaced with a hockey puck with different physics. Positive reception to the ice hockey mode led to it being extended for a few weeks after the holiday season. Snow Day was permanently added to the mutator settings for private matches and exhibition games on February 10 2016. ""Hoops"" a game mode based on basketball was added on April 26 2016. A separate ""Rumble"" mode which incorporates unusual power ups such as the ability to freeze the ball in place or cause a single opponent to have difficulty controlling their car was added on September 8 2016 as well as including with the update the new ""Crates"" system. An update in December 2016 known as ""Starbase ARC"" (based on Psyonix' mobile game ARC Squadron) added support for custom arenas for Windows players supported through Steam Workshop along with other new content.A new game mode Dropshot was added in a March 2017 update. It takes place on an arena without any goals and a field made of hexagonal tiles and uses a ball that becomes electrified after successful strikes or passes. Players use the ball to mark tiles on the opposing's side of the field while the ball is electrified marked tiles are then removed from the field when the electrified ball hits them or marked tiles in contact with it creating a goal for the team. Once a team scores the floor on that side resets to normal (while the floor on the scoring team's side retains any existing damage).In September 2018 Pysonix added a battle pass feature to the game known as the ""Rocket Pass"". Each pass which lasts a few months has challenges and other opportunities through playing Rocket League that allow players to increase the tier of the Pass from which new unique customization options tied to that pass can be unlocked. While the Rocket Pass is free to all players a flat cost premium one can be purchased which accelerates its level up rate.Airbourne cars above a football pitch attempting to hit a ball situated beneath themA car sits idly on a football pitch as another flies above him following an explosion at the goal postsPsyonix's Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars (left) immediately preceded and inspired the development of Rocket League (right) which would make vast improvements upon Battle Cars' gameplay and online features.Psyonix had previously developed Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket Powered Battle Cars in 2008 for the PlayStation 3. That title itself bore out from previous modifications that Psyonix' founder Dave Hagewood had done for Unreal Tournament 2003 by expanding out vehicle based gameplay that Epic Games had already set in place in the engine into a new game mode called Onslaught. 23 For this Hagewood was hired as a contractor by Epic for Unreal Tournament 2004 specifically for incorporating the Onslaught mode as an official part of the game. 24 Hagewood used his experience at Epic to found Psyonix. Among other contract projects Psyonix worked to try to find a way to make racing the Unreal vehicles in a physics based engine enjoyable. They had toyed with several options such as race modes or mazes but found that when they added a ball to the arena to be pushed by the vehicles they had hit upon the right formula which would become Battle Cars. 24 Further to the success was the addition of the rocket powered cars this originally was to be a simple speed boost.",Rocket League®,5,1865,7875,1336,5

Keys which are very important to the game are extremely hard to obtain especially for any beginners.

4/29/2015,0,0,275,Recommended,GTA V Story Mode The story mode is long exciting and fun and it can give you a lot of funny moments.Been playing this constantly and is never tired of it.There is so much to do here some examples is to play golf darts or tennis.This is great for players that love to do sports in real life or those who are interested in sports.When playing for a while doing random activities that comes up I must say they really put effort in this game for us.GTA Online This is just like the story mode but much better.You can for example play with friends and play heists or missions that can help you rank up and earn money to purchase an apartment or cars.All activities works here as well so you can play together with friends or just random strangers from an online lobby.There is so much to do in GTA Online that I can't describe all of them but if you are interested in a fun multiplayer game to play with friends then GTA V is certainly the choice for you.No matter how long you play for you can still have fun playing.I rate this game an 9/10 for the reason that it is very fun playing with friends and just hang out.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,275,1112,214,5

1/22/2019,2,3,83,Not Recommended,Product received for free. This game is one of the most overrated I have ever played and probably the most overrated RPG I have ever played.It has absolutely no respect for your time and nearly every aspect of the game is either monotonous like searching thousands of crates (if you don't you're undergeared) or every difficulty check fight requiring setup like shifting barrels or teleporting targets during dialogue. I was very disappointed with the linearity in effective character builds at high difficulty as a big fan of turn based strategy.The other aspects of the game are either obtuse and completely pointless (like the crafting system the fact the whole map loads at once or how some questlines are structured) or decent like the OST voice acting for named NPCs and the writing in the earlier parts of the game. If I had not received this game as a gift and played with a group of friends I never would have even bothered to make it past act 2. Normally I would say I never would have bothered to see the ending but I didn't actually end up seeing the ending anyway because our playthrough had a gamebreaking bug where the narrator locks after the last boss.,Divinity: Original Sin 2 - Definitive Edition,1,83,1169,206,1

I've played many different games solo and with friends and while many are great there are only 2 that keep me coming back for more and that is Astroneer and The Forest. To me they are different sides of the same coin and both are defintly worth the play. I played this for a few hours when I first got it but it was extremely choppy and laggy and had bad framerate all because of my laptop I have to play on. However they have had a few updates since I last really played and I tested it out again to find everything has been polished alot more and runs much smoother! I can finally sit down and really get into this game now and to me that alone is worth my time. This is probably going to become one of my biggest titles I'll play between classes on campus since its so relaxed calm and goes at whatever pace I wish.

The game idea in my opinion isn't very good I don't know? Soccer and Cars don't go together very well and the game is super hard to learn. There is also no feeling that you get whenever you finally achieve a win on this game.

I'm still enjoying this game but I've noticed that it takes about 30+ seconds to find a match in Solo/TPP in NA server which makes me think that many people have left the game and there remains only skilled players. Due to the nature of Battle Royal game it has been getting harder to win a game.To spend the hard earned BP you can buy a crate or change the appearance of your character. However for 4 out 5 times you will get pay to open crates. I'd be fine if there's only a couple of premium crates that requires keys but let alone that you wouldn't get free to open crates most of the time the key itself is too expensive. I have 50+ crates that I can't open without keys in my inventory and if I buy all the keys to open them up it will cost me 125+ dollars.If you are tired of trolls in Overwatch League of Legends or any other games and care to try something new it is worth giving it a try but it will be much harder to enjoy it as a competitive player given the nature of the game.

The story was great and have played it was twice and very great all though it doesn't have that ""story line"" that you can follow it's just kind of characters you are given and then you start following a story I wish GTA would follow through with GTA 4 story would match GTA 5 better.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,495,741,154,1

4/14/2015,0,0,365,Recommended,I am just going to write a short review to show my side coming from the Xbox 360 version to PC.At first I was skeptical of the PC version suffering from the same faults as past GTA PC releases. GTA5 ended up being one of the best launches in recent history. Game immediately ran smoothly and the difference in consistency compared to the 360 is amazing. I almost feel like I am finally playing the game for the first time. Visually stunning.People may gripe about a $60 price tag but R* doesn't take your money for granted. I've bought premium or season passes in many other games but I was far happier simply buying GTA5 twice to enjoy this amazing PC edition.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,365,661,122,5

6/9/2018,0,0,169,Not Recommended,"First and foremost its expected that GTA has a good singleplayer campaign and they don't disappoint there. With 3 main characters I thought it could get pretty unorganized but the devs did an excellent job keeping the campaign cohesive between all three characters and giving them each their own unique feel. One is example is they each get their own side missions and contribute their efforts to the main story. Driving/Combat/Thrills are all there and brilliant. An important note In GTA 4 there was a ""tunneling effect"" when driving that has been removed. I thought It added an interesting element to take into account when driving at high speeds but it was a bit overboard on the effect so I'm kind of glad they got rid of it. I don't think it would've worked well enough in this iteration. An FPS mode was added in a later patch honestly was a bit disappointed by its implementation why? Well for one the interiors of the vehicles look pretty garbage hardly any attention was made to them and there's nothing really to interact with inside your car so its pretty pointless in that aspect. I guess if you like racing and shooting in fpv then its nice to have. The one thing I really really missed was being able to buy property in GTA 4 and that's back for GTA 5. But its almost like an afterthought in the singleplayer sure you can buy your garages and it'll save your vehicles but when you buy businesses you can't go inside them they cost a rediculous amount like $150 million or whatever for a beat up old theatre. The sad part is that after you finish the story you don't even get enough money to buy a good portion of commercial stuff. They do offer a bit of content in free mode but it gets stale and highly repetitive after only a couple missions. Helipads and Docks are now available to buy in GTA5 so if you have helicopters and boats you can store them there. Overrall I kind of enjoyed the story in GTA 4 a bit more than in GTA5 you could feel your progression in a very real way you started from the bottom and slowly got better and better the map started to open up more and you could meet new people. The relationship system was equal parts interesting and annoying though it didn't feel tacky. Trying to do stuff with contacts in GTA 5 feels tacky they almost never pick up when you call them and they never want to do anything. If you're lucky you may discover a few new missions.As for GTA online gameplay well that part surprised me a bit I don't think I've ever played in a multiplayer where elements and characters from the singleplayer carried over to the multiplayer space as much as it does in GTA 5. Sure its a supporting actor running the show but its a nice change to see cutscenes missions and meaningful content to do in GTA online. Note Trevor does make appearances. The quality and quantity of customization is really good though in an odd move they made a seperate specialty car shop (not the odd part) that is firstly blocked by an ingame paywall so before they even touch your car you have to pay them and then once you do the customization options cost such a significant enough amount that its almost not even worth it. The DLC thats been added to the online game has introduced some cool content but it too gets pretty repetitive. The sad part is is that what the devs imagined as the most fun part of this content is also what ruins the experience. Basically you have to do a job that almost always involves a bit of transporting and its the rest of the players in the lobby's choice to stop you or make it incredibly difficult that the payout isn't even worth it. Sounds kind of fun right? Well it sort of can be with a group of friends. The problem is for solo players or even groups for that matter are at a serious disadvantage from the beginning. Why? Well for one the opposing side gets access to some seriously OP vehicles and tools (to be fair so does the transporters if you have enough buddies). I'm talking wiping you in one shot type of OP traditional weapons aren't really that good enough OP must have equalivalent type of vehicle to counter it OP. Or there is absolutely no counter type of OP. Everything before that last one alludes to some powerful favorite vehicles of the wealthy. Like a Delorean that can shoot missles and take off and land and also dodge homing rockets with ease or there's the very similiar motorcycle version that seems faster. Apache helicopters attack jets the batmobile etc. But one thing you can't stop no matter what you do is the Orbital Cannon. This sucker shoots down a beam that pretty much instantly wipes whoever and whatever is in its target radius and there is not one godd*mn thing you can do. There are limitations in place like it costs $1 million each shot and it has a long cooldown after you use it. One counter would be maybe to send out a decoy and hope the aggressor takes the bait but if your facing say a lobby that all have access to the weapon then there really is no counter. As you'd expect this entire system opens the game up to a heavy amount of griefing. Hacking is also rampant with groups of people embracing god mode or spawning random obstacles that basically make the mission or free mode unplayable. Below I'll address actually getting into an online session.Loading....(20 mins later)No seriously if your an average joe with an outdated processor and still using a hard drive expect to have enough free time to get a haircut (don't even both setting up an appointment the extra 10 min wait is well worth it) get that done come back and THEN GTA Online MAY HAVE loaded if it didn't get some random error teleporting you back to the main screen or reinstancing you into Singleplayer. I mean honestly this game has one of the worst if not THE worst loading screen I've ever seen slightly ahead of Skyrim on 3rd Generation consoles (PS3/Xbox 360). Because at least with Skyrim it would load decent enough that some of the longest loading screens would still be a surprise. For a game with a budget reaching over $250 million (the highest ever for a video game and topping most hollywood film budgets) that's a huge disappointment. I expect more out of the developer to optimize their game. To their credit the game as a whole is well optimized but the online loading screens are horrendous. And hey if it's just a matter of not having enough time to get it addressed by the release date then yeah I'm willing to give you some leeway if you at least say your working on it. I mean surely after the horrendous launch issues I could understand if it would be on the backburner till that was cleaned up but even now 3 years past release and yet still no fix. It's unacceptable. Money and Time clearly weren't the issues with the game grossing over $6 billion in revenue (most ever for a media form). Its just a simple case of Rockstar the developer and Take Two Interactive the publisher (TakeTwo owns Rockstar Games and its their publicly traded parent company) taking their cash cow and running. That's not a tactic I support so I'll be sure to remember that when I consider buying the next installment if there will be one or a TakeTwo game in general.Final Thoughts If your looking for a game with a solid campaign and a trolley multiplayer then GTA 5 is your game. Personally for me I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this game. There is classic GTA fun there but its overhyped.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,169,7394,1353,1

Surviving with friends is fun and can get you killed easliy at times but all worth it in the end. The exhilarating feeling when a good killer chasing you is dreadfull escaping is almost impossilbe using the resources around the map just stalls the killer for your team to get the objectives Without team work the game almost a lost depending how good of a player you are.

It would be nice if the game would actually recognize that my laptop has a GTX 960m card in it and not force me to use the Intel graphics chipset. Looks like I'll be sticking with the original release but hey at least this was free. I can see why now.UPDATE 1 After spending some time in the NVIDIA Control Panel and setting it to force the GTX960M performance has improved greatly. It's getting there but I'll have to wait until it gets official NVIDIA support before I change my opinion on the game. On another bright side the load times are much faster.UPDATE 2 Performance is much better since doing the switch. While I normally will play at 1080p Medium settings (which results in between 45 and 60fps ) playing on Ultra sets it between 30 and 40.UPDATE 3 Can now play at 900p Ultra with a more than adequate frame rate.

To many killers with overlapping features (Invisibility and one hit weapons...) The amount of hooks in each map is too many. There has been one time in 50 hours of gameplay I have wiggled off the shoulder. Even with offerings to lower the amount of spawned hooks it is still way too many.The list for both can go on but overall the game has something for everyone. I do wish that the Killers were less over powered when it comes to abilitys because playing this game and being the first to die multiple games in a row it is the most fustrating thing!Either way It is definetly a game to get if you enjoy tense moments and a good laugh with your mates or to blow off some steam and kill a few people.

Now it's time to face the wrath of yet another negative review rockstar. Take two interactive and Rockstar are only going to make this worse for themselves. You guys better rip that cease and desist letter and burn it. Because it's all one big giant jokeEDIT I do now rate this game positive. BUT. there's still ONE thing rockstar ONE thing. why the hell do you feel the need to take our money? why the hell do you feel the need to listen to kids 10 12 that love to take their parent's credit cards and buy a dozen shark cards? huh? how about doing the opposite of that and actually investing your time into something better with the game like adding a BIG dlc for singleplayer. this game has potential it really does. but don't ruin it.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,306,1007,187,5

I like the sounds though some people dont the FPS on the main is ok with a few tweaks yes it dips in large towns but its mainly playable if not 144hz super pc master race smooth.Im playing at 4k with a 1080 overclocked to 2100hz so i have the GPU grunt and being 4k 60fps is my limit lowest it drops is 40 45 in the towns not great but playable. (AA is off by the way i dont think you need it at 4k and it frees up the frames)some people dont like the price but ive had my fun for 27.99 in the first week alone and its only going to get better.First week is seeing some good patches (server &amp Client) and good communication from the Devs which has to be a good thing.Very much worth the money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,4,120,990,197,4

3/4/2018,0,0,693,Recommended,This game is truly phenomonal there's just something special about the feeling of reward this game grants you along with the feeling of immense risk you have to frequently undertake that ultimately will leave you hooked. This game is extremely addicting from the farming to building and the PVP the game mechanics are sensational and the dev team is committed to making this game even better proven by their dedication to weekly updates. The game has its fair share of issues as all games do with cheaters &amp general toxicity in the community but overall most player interactions are entertaining and add to the experience. Playing solo is extremely difficult so new players should probably get a small group together to get the most enjoyment out of the game. This game will leave you with so amazing moments and is definitely value for money would highly recommend this game to anyone who's looking for a new way to kill time ),Rust,5,693,931,161,5

Survivor is fairly easy to play and in my opinion can be more fun than killer at times but don't let that dissuade you from trying killer out. Playing the killer can be very stressful and difficult at times but the better you get the more fun and rewarding it is to destroy teams of survivors as your favourite killer.

Besides the toxic community this game is the best survival game you will find out there. And i am sure of that.All those negative comments are just talking about how bad the community is. Well here is a word that may help you understand something.SURVIVALSo you can tell me that if a naked man is running across your shelter acting weird and you have a rifle locked and loaded your NOT gonna shoot him?Now i know a lot of people are probably saying ""You have played for not even 2 hours you know nothing about the game.""Thats true. But what i DO know is that this is a SURVIVAL game if you get killed you have to accept it. If you get murdered by a clan of 30 people you have to accept it. If some 8 year old squeeker blows your base up and leaves signs of everywhere after raiding it You have to accept it.From playing this game for only an HOUR SO FAR i can tell this will be one of my favorite games. don't let those raging kids writing negative reviews about the bad community change your thinking there is nothing wrong with this game.",Rust,3,5,1148,221,3

But then again the whole idea is to force players to buy Shark Cards. The load time on this game is ridiculously long and I am surprised the game isn't officially called ""Loading Simulator.""

Broken Limb penatration and sound bugs poor hit reg sometimes along with broken fps every patch. Interpolation is terrible in this game as well. For this game to survive fps will need to be fixed so its over 100 loot will need to be increased for all maps not just san hok limb penatration will need to be taken out till they fix it and circles will need to be slowed down till they fix the loot. If they don't make these changes Fortnite and COD4 br are gonna take even more of pubg community leaving this game to the trolls and hardcore pubg fans. If a dev reads this take it seriously it's not just my salty opinion it is literally the opinion of every random duo and friend and streamer I have talked to or seen. Don't get me wrong I know writing code for games is hard but that is no excuse it is your job if something is broken and you can't fix it you take it out of the game untill you can fix it like limb pen then re add it to test server test it and add it once it's fixed.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,1179,1143,227,1

2/6/2018,0,0,357,Not Recommended,For a game designed to be fair and esports friendly the inconsistencies ranging from server issues to ridiculous bugs leave a bitter taste that only gets worse. You will be more upset than happy more disappointed than satisfied more outraged than pleased while playing this game. The sole reason for the player count despite negative reviews is that the alternatives are far worse than PUBG. For any type of game I would overlook things like dying instantly while climbing a ledge a bike instantly killing you while trying to make it stand or people not dying despite 2 point blank hits to the belly with a shotgun because of abysmal tick rate and server capacity but not this game. This is a battle royale game and any unfair element can not be forgiven. Working your off for 20 minutes giving your all fully focused and then dying to uncontrollable flaws in the game is frankly a common experience in this game. I used to think the bugs and lag were exaggerated and the game was still pretty playable but after 100 hours when the joy of winning your first game or getting several kills in a game disappear I see the truth now. This is a game with great potential that tries it's absolute hardest to give the players a bad experience.

12/21/2016,0,0,20,Recommended,Even though it's in pre alpha it's a wonderful game that I feel is worth $20. I have never crashed or lagged on this game and it looks absolutely beautiful. Of course since it is a pre alpha there are some rough edges like you cant mine stuff without making a huge crater and you can't combat the gas in caves which has killed me numerous times. Vehicle of course are glitchy as well as multiplayer. When playing you just have to focus on the the main goal which is that the $20 you spent will go towards funding the game and make it better. I'm not typically a fan of these types of games but this really has my attention.EDIT Good for using when you're getting off at a game and need to cooldown.

If you are debating about getting this game keep this in mind.(1) You will not be good at it at first. Someone is going to be better than you but as soon as you grind and keep getting comfortable with the game you will grow to love this game. (2) You will not get bored of this game. People say this game is only fun with friends. Although having friends can lead to a more fun experience having friends does not matter. about 40 hours of the game i've played (i have 50 at this time and plan to exceed that) are playing solo and I haven't found a dull moment yet. (3) Remember when you were a kid and you played minecraft? IF you have ever played the gamemode ""Survival Games"" on minecraft and enjoyed it this is very similar. (just better everything pretty much). (4) you like raging? In a solo game I survived the until there were only 2 players left. Me and someone else. The white circle is closing and i am decked out in level 3 equipment a Vector and a Kar98k. As i enter the house the white circling is closing upon I get shotgunned by someone camping behind a door.

I mean everyone will kos you for no reason not allowing you to get materials and stuff done. Also the key system is to the point where if you get killed you loose everything because some griefer takes it and loots everything. Its rediculous specially sense its annoying to have to build over and over and over and over again. I am done with this game and do not reccomend it because its just griefers and people that kos you even on community servers.

The Single player is good i would say rly good but that's about the only thing you can truly enjoy. what rly annoys me is that they keep releasing new DLC's with new cars boats houses ect but only for multiplayer. If you buy this game for single player only you kind fell forgotten because R* wont ever add new functionalities to SP.Now if you do go to MP thats where the real trouble begins.First you have to wait about 2 3 minutes to enter a session after that you can enjoy the open world with a maximum of 30 players usually 10...Next you need money and for that you have to do ""activities"" the problem is you have to go trough a loading screen too 1 Find a new seasion (2 min)2 Wait for players (5 15 min if they ever show you have to choose popular ones or forget it you cant do it alone)3 begin the mission (2 min)4 end the mission and return to the open world (2 5 min)You can waste about 15 min in loading screens and sometimes you dont even play that long.Apart from this they dont seem to give you new ways to make good money the DLC's keep getting more and more expensive but you are still left with the same tools to make money which means grinding times are now impossible if you have a life.If you want to try the game buy it in sale and dont expect R* to care about your experince the only thing they see is money.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,908,1407,278,1

Rockstar/Take Two have shown to be very anti consumer after the release of GTA V. This further cements the notion and I and many others are not having it.You do not flat out blanket ban the use of mods. If your company as a whole does not like modding fine but do not use measures to prevent it. PC gaming is about freedom and employing these practices are scummy.I do not recommend until they fix this. Even then the Online is a broken pile of crap. It's essentially a free to play (or moreso pay to win) game that you actually have to buy. Every aspect of the Online mode is meant to milk as much money from you. Whether it's $500 at a time or $10 000. Everything is ridiculously expensive and comes with a price.I seriously hate post GTA V Rockstar.

And it's just plain fun to take down giant monsters with a group of hunters. It's not perfect and if you care about story in games it's not going to be anything amazing.

Online is very grindy just to get a damn car no missions payout enough and replaying the same missions too requently makes your mission pay lower. Let's not forget that Single Player is short and kind of boring and SP DLC was teased for a while and there's no sign of it.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,253,500,94,1

7/14/2015,0,0,224,Recommended,First off i love this game in every physical aspect i love the concept i love the gameplay i love the cars the customisations and of course the baloon crowd. if i were to judge the game soely on its tecnical aspects 10/10 no question. BUT there are issues with the most important feature of the game multiplayer. you can rarely join a match (if you dont get in within a minute you may as well restart the game and try again) and when you do get into a match the game is loaded with people who have terrible pings causing the entire team to lag for example when we were up 2 0 they came back and won 4 2 in the last 20 seconds because we couldnt see a THING until it already happened. the replays didnt help either. just a ball randomly shooting into the goal at 120 kph while everyone was lagging across the feild. i had a ping of 30 so it was caused by someone else. intentionally done or not this was angering.i would assume private matches are better because you can control who joins but as of now none of my freinds own the game. overall this game gets an 8/10 im knocking off 2 points for all the various issues with online if those get fixed consider this a 10/10.,Rocket League®,5,224,1171,228,5

2/1/2019,0,0,34,Recommended,I was rendered giddy with joy and terro upon booting up and playing the RE2 remake. I played the originals as a kid and I remember absolutely adoring the remake of the original which as a 100% improvement over the first game. The RE2 remake is even more a joy. Id give the game a 9.5/10 but I am a bit baised as a long term Resident Evil fan so maybe its more like a 7 or an 8 for people who arent fans of the genre or series.That being said I was so severely dissapointed after Resident Evil 5 that I stopped buying the games entirely when I saw RE6 I almost considered the purchase but even still to this day have not (I admit I might after getting hyped up after playing this however). I thought the entire classic genre of RE was dead and lost to a bygone era but this remake has inspired me by giving us a Resident Evil that ditches the clunky controls and camera angles of the originals whilst still maintaining the ambient feel and style of the originals. RE2 expands and is faithful to the original gameplay and story whilst adding enough minor changes to keep veterans like me from finding it predictable even the voice acting is pretty decent.We really are back to Survival Horror with this latest remake this is the style of game I was hoping for at the Resident Evil 4 and 5 launches and I had lost hope we would ever get a true Resident Evil game ever again. I am beyond ecstatic to report that I was wrong and if Capcom releases a Resident Evil 3 remake in the same style as this one you can consider me sold. What a wonderful release for 2019 a shining gem amongst the seas of hollow content and microtransactions.,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,3,34,1629,310,3

6/16/2017,0,0,1189,Not Recommended,Enjoying this game has gotten more and more difficult over time. EVERYTHING has gotten expensive these days but the legitimate ways to pay for them have not changed.If you want to host one of the new Weaponized Vehicle missions (which is the only way to get discounts on the new vehicles) you have to pay a MINIMUM of $GTA 2 290 000. For the cheapest bunker and the cheapest Mobile Ops truck with absolutely no options. But unless you've dropped fifty real world dollars on a Shark Card there's no quick and legitimate way to get that money. Your best chance would be to host the Pacific Standard heist eight or nine times a tough and time consuming affair on its own.Once you've managed to scrape enough cash together to afford the bunker and the truck you will likely be unhappy to find out that all the fun toys they show off in this update weapon mods vehicle upgrades etc. are all hidden behind more paywalls. You can either wait for each item to be 'researched' or you can pay to have the research 'fast tracked' for a hefty fee. It takes about 8.5 hours per unlock time. Keep in mind that most of the items are things like weapon liveries and vehicle paint jobs. And you don't get to choose which items get researched when. Total . Paying for all the upgrades and focusing all bunker staff exclusively on research... it will still take about 6 hours per item.If you don't want to wait that long fast tracking research costs $GTA 225 000 per item. To pay to unlock every single item will cost you $GTA 10 350 000 for everything. That's over $150 USD's worth of Shark Cards. Or you can wait for about 380 hours for everything to be researched.Personally I'd rather just wait for a generous modder to drop some cash on me. That way I won't have to wait 17 straight days for unlocks (not counting things like sleeping or going to work) or literally spend my whole paycheck on Shark Cards.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,1189,1891,347,1

4/5/2018,0,0,124,Recommended,The game is fun however balancing is a big issue. Most games seem to be survivor sided as the killer can only get good to a point based on their ability going up against 4 survivors.Quick points Pros Characters (Survivors) All survivors bring helpful perks to the table allowing for diverse amounts of strategies.Characters (Killers) All killers play different from each other due to their powers.Maps All maps give survivors a number of ways to hide from the killer and traverse the map.Character Progression The bloodweb system is quite cool as you don't know what perks and upgrades you will get when you go for your next level up.Cons Pallets These are extremely helpful for survivors to escape the killer as the killers are generally faster than them and will eventually catch them. However the amount of pallets there are on the map are absurd at times and between them and windows survivors can perform the strategy of pallet looping meaning the killer can go through a whole match without getting a single hit.Survivors The survivors while they do bring perks these perks can be learned by all other survivors meaning that by the end of the game if you max out all your survivors there is no variation between them apart from looks. Killers at least have unique powers.Ranking system The ranking system does not seem to work in the slightest...it is supposed to mean that a rank 15 killer goes up against survivors around their rank. I just had a match where I went up against a rank 16 rank 7 and two rank 1 survivors...doesn't seem fair.Killers apparently aren't allowed to do their jobs? A complaint i've seen go around is that people are annoyed when killers camp dying survivors. From the survivors perspective yes this sucks as you basically have no way of getting healed from other survivors. From a killers perspective this is a double edged sword. While yes it may secure a kill you are not going around trying to stop other survivors from completing their objectives. There are more reasons survivors get angry but I won't get into them.The game itself is a lot of fun for both survivors and killers as long as you are willing to take the time to practice and understand the roles and playstyles. Don't just go into this game expecting to win (if you do then good on you) but go in to hae fun if you aren't having fun look at what you did and what you could do better for the next time.,Dead by Daylight,4,124,2404,428,4

Buy it now and deal with the frustrating days or buy it later when they've got the game and servers more stabilized and you don't have to deal with the crashes laggy servers and racist children that fill the lobby.In a few months this game will be recommended highly.

8/4/2015,0,0,152,Recommended,If you have ever enjoyed ANY GTA game GET THIS! I've waited a long time for this game I waited for the console peasants to finish beta testing it for us PC gamers ) Then i had to upgrade my pc to play it as its meant to be ( and then finally i got to play it properly just wow!! It is just pure gaming fun distilled to 1000% proof! The way you switch between three very different characters keeps it interesting and at times hilarious (Trevor!) and the whole place just feels so alive like no game ive seen even down to getting flipped off by npc drivers when you prang their car! There is so much depth to the game the random people you come across asking for help and starting a mini mission and your options as to wether to help or.. well.. no no spoilers here ) The vehicles and their upgrades the sports the heists!! the stock market the properties and businesses available to buy and run the friends and families of each character and of course what would GTA be without the strippers and ladies of the night! I was a HUGE fan of GTA vice city and that game took the franchise to another level for me. Although I've loved all the subsequent GTA's to some degree i think this is the first time rockstar have really topped vice city with style. (plz plz plz do a vice city remake with the gta v engine though!!!) To me this is what gaming is about being dropped into another living breathing world where you can do whatever you want. Drive carefully and wait for the green light... or get out and waste everyone in sight (except the puppydogs ofc!) with sniper rifle/sawn off shotgun/stinger missiles or knuckle dusters and try to outrun the law on land sea and air! oh.. and now and then actually play the amazing storyline out... Thankyou to rockstar for keeping this franchise going! as long as you keep making them Ill keep buying them! TL DR JUST GET IT! FOR REAL THO!,Grand Theft Auto V,4,152,1877,354,4

10/23/2016,0,0,19,Recommended,I have played this game quite a bit and all the people that say the game doesn't work makes me wonder if they verified their files because yes one of my friends did have problems but once they verified the files it worked fine. Love the mechanic of the game as they work the way they are supposed to people don't realize that camping is kind of required or it would be too easy for survivors to win. Don't like the self healing? Get the perk that allows you to see where survivors that are healing. There is a counter to every part that feels overpowered which seperates this game from a bunch of other games already. Yes matchmaking is a little annoying but it takes about 10 seconds stop thinking that there will at some point be no problems. Humans are flawed and can't make anything perfect deal with it. This game is amazing and is definitely closer to being perfect than a lot of other games that are considered amazing because you actually have to think.,Dead by Daylight,3,19,961,178,3

10/30/2016,0,0,11,Not Recommended,"I can sum up what's wrong with this game in one sentence so bear with me as I explain that sentence. ""There is no native Linux client"" A significant number of developers publishers and gamers read a sentence like that and simply dismiss it out of hand for a variety of reasons with none of those reasons being valid. The point of developing a Linux client for any game or any software package is not for fiscal return in sales nor just for community goodwill. It isn't to showcase technical prowess or to grow a new market. Not is it just to hush up a very vocal stastical minority of players.The point of developing for Linux is that it enforces Good Coding Practices. Applications that are cross developed for Linux and Windows sets a number of high barriers a developer must address. One of those barriers is code documetation. With multiple operating systems in play code must be well documented so that anybody else reading the code later will know what the original developer intended.Developing with cross platform targets in mind from the start also forces the developer to avoid Operating System specific functions. Developers also have an incentive to avoid Operating System specific API's. Native cross platform development also makes it more likely that the developer will leverage more robust development tools check more of the code for errors before compiling get more detailed reports afterwards on what broke during compiling and ultimately produce cleaner code as a result. Native cross platform development forces developers especially game developers to actually test their shader code on a variety of different hardware types. Supporting AMD alone for example could mean making sure OpenGL and Vulkan shader code runs under as many as 4 different drivers. The more physical graphics cards a developer tests against in house and the more drivers against which those graphics cards are tested make it far more likely that bad or error'd code will be noticed and can be corrected. The sheer scale scope and ambition that Bethesda puts into their games is only matched by what appears to be the sheer scale and scope of Bethesda's apathic coding practices. Bethesda games are legendary for massive bugs glitches and any number of wide ranging issues that would normally spell death for any other developer. From what I've experienced players love Bethesda games because there's something to those games that is more compelling than the broken clients used to play those games.For years players have begged Bethesda to open up their game clients under Open Source licenses. For years players have begged Bethesda to let the players fix those game clients at the code level not at some downloadable mod level. For years Bethesda has responded with a flat ""No"" I harbor no doubt that if Bethesda had released the Fallout 4 engine under an Open Source license and let the player base bring Skyrim into that engine then there would have been something special. There wouldn't have been sound files that were compressed using some well let's just leave it at noting that the sound is not compressed using a format from Xiph. There wouldn't have been texture packs that were left untouched. There wouldn't have been broken shader codes. If anything it's likely that the extremely talented player base would have ported the graphics code into Vulkan.When I saw Skyrim Special Edition land with no native Linux client as a Zero Day Launch I knew without even checking anything else or even loading the game up that Bethesda hadn't followed coding practices. I knew just from the lack of a product that the code probably had not been tested on a wide range of hardware or driver sets. I knew that Bethesda probably hadn't used platform agnostic development tools and likely had a wide range of Operating System workarounds black boxes and kludges in the ported game. Other developers might want to take notes. Supporting Linux platforms during the product development process as a cross compile with Windows isn't just to make the fan base feel good. It's a very practical and very effective method at making sure that when the product launches... it's a product that works. Not one that locks up and does nothing for hours on end.",The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition,1,11,4238,714,1

4/20/2015,0,0,781,Recommended,"GTA has been a favorite series of mine since the first game. In those days it was very convenient for party play pop in some cheats and hand off to the next person when you died. Nobody did the missions except if you were the only one playing. This trend continued on into 2 and 3 where multiplayer either did not exist (or on PC couldn't get it to work easily) or didn't matter. The real first experience with multiplayer I had was Multi Theft Auto for Vice City. From that moment on the dream of multiplayer GTA meant stupid impossible feats. San Andreas reached that peak in singleplayer but lacked multiplayer beyond co op (sad). GTA has many capacities for GTA V you have to take the game as two seperate parts delineated on borders of functionality. GTA Online is to a lesser degree an excellent game however the reason one would play GTA Online is because singleplayer after finishing the story becomes a dull boring affair with little of the emergent content present in GTAO. That emergent content however is dull too once you've become accustomed to it. If you have imagination GTA (any GTA) can be enjoyable.I will discuss both GTAO and GTA V in each facet to help you determine whether this game is a heap of dog crap or a brilliant postmodern mockery of sandbox games. First of all GTAO has microtransactions and it is stupid. It goes against everything imaginable for a decent company like Rockstar to engage in this nonsense microtransactions are a nuisance and a micro economy of fake money injected into games using your real money. It is unscrupulous and unethical and I think this personally that it is a great albeit evil business model. GTAO might be preying on stupid casual or lazy players who suck at GTA are 12 and have mom's credit card or weary married too young males who work a lot and just buy their way to success in P2W games. Still endorsing a Dave and Buster's style microeconomy of optional pay walls to content is tantamount to encouraging it even if you plan to gain marginal sales on their Shark Cards (they made a lot of money actually).GTAO and singelplayer suffer from the same gameplay issues that every GTA eventually runs into GTAO makes up for lack of minigames and activities by always adding more content over time. As of yet singleplayer is dead due to no new content injection. A major change to the gameplay is the quality of graphics and the new viewpoint. The first person view adds immense icing on the cake of new graphical fidelity which puts the game far ahead of any competitor. Even when textures look like runny jpeg slosh the after effects and great breadth of options mean that even without texture modding the game will look fine for quite a while. GTA IV is still getting new leases on life because both games leave a lot of room for personal taste for modders to eventually exploit and manipulate to get more intensive graphics (yet to be seen but the game just came out). The lowest generation versions (PS3 and 360) were quite bad looking washy textures and terrible aliasing abounding but the games still had excellent visionary quality for that generation's horribly gimped graphical power. It's quite an achievement that even on low settings the game is functional functional is the least I can say for games since the last big sandbox games I played a lot Black Flag and Watchdogs were pretty... pretty . They were functional messes at their best and glitchy contorted eppileptic siezures at worst. GTA V on PC still has glitches (though I have had few pop in issues) and crashing but it's far more stable than many multi console port/mish mash games I've been uncomfortable playing.A major issue I have with these games that is GTA V's various versions is that as updates and content have been implemented there is a major difference between singleplayer and multiplayer driving/handling configurations. Cars go slow or faster depending on the patch and there's awful discrepencies even in Online alone between the lag you experience when I do normal missions in full servers on this PC version I rarely experience floating cars and pop in. Now in every Heist related mission there is lag pop in invisible cars and fgloating cars dropping in on me. Consistent with PS3 (my previous generation version) Rockstar expends a lot of energy issuing small one day patches that clear up exploits and glitches but not ones that functionally break the game! No! They focus on exploits and hacking related to people griefing or making money (taking away from their Shark Card revenue) or duplicating cars. This goes hand in hand with contentious still approaches to ""bad sports."" I have never even been fully on bad sport lobbies but I hate that you cannot avoid it. Accidental car destructiuon happens constantly. GTA IV had many of the greater qualities that made fan created multiplayer (especially SAMP) so much fun in other words we need to stop having draconian rules about personal vehicles. Implement a server list so people can implement rules like ""no cops"" or ""no personal vehicle insurance claims."" Being able to ban or give tanks to players outside of missions would be a plus more control of the lobby like free mode would make this game immensely better! GTA IV multiplayer was enjoyable yet I do not want to give up new ideas like persitant weapons or personal vehicles but insurance and whatnot is so superfluous and pointless that I cannot stand it. I get it Rockstar! Sticky bombing peoples cars in a game about robbery and murder is a bully behavior (from the guys who made a great game called BULLY). The soundtrack is excellent though a lot of wierdness comes from the ambient soundtrack. I just wish there was a seperate soundbar for just THAT ambient music. The roster of artists is very good varied large. One feature I wish would one day be added is updates with new music after launch... a pipedream I know but GTAO is being built on a longterm profit and update model. As for the sound effects they are superb. The game has a quality more like GTA IV where I don't hear a lot of the sam pedestrian dialogue but it also falls in line with an overly serious tone the game takes (no quotable dumb pedestrian lines).As for story and this is my final topic I can only be brief. There's many elements to the characterizations and the cast that makes the game a compelling GAME and not some cinematic experience. There are definitely moments where it goes over into that territory but often this is temporary and is pointed out. We are not given characters that fall down under examination or have no criticism from the world beyond police and an antagonist. There is self deprecation and there is deprecation from these characters' families and friends. As for the preachy left wing/right wing saoccer mom/social justice warrior critiques of this game's treatment of LGBT topics this game is incredibly fair and kind to everyone involved. Major themes critique the protaganists their society and the enemies that motivate the main characters. You're going to feel sorry for things you do. I don't know how this is any less a story about reluctant criminals than the previous in 3 it's forced revenge to deal with a romantic betrayal. In Vice City it's forced independence to escape your betrayers. In San Andreas it's forced everything by everyone often because of their crimes and weakness. GTA IV was about an immigrant dealing with America forced to flee his past. Now we have three protaganists fitting these previous games (Franklin and CJ Michael and Vercetti Trevor and Claude).In closing I give it a number out of a number.GTA is still hectic even if you don't like the HD era. It's a ing parody of its own meaningless plagiarized movie plots. Online is fine and good even when it disappoints... you'll still play it. And where's the co op R*??? WHERE?!",Grand Theft Auto V,5,781,7842,1368,5

Add on cars really help the game and you don't have to worry about your original game files getting corrupted. The campaign is amazing like always in the GTA series.

I bought This game While it 50% off so It's worth it50% happened On Steam Sale Back in 2016 I think But I just Bought this recently So if you want to get the cheap one Probably you have to wait until steam sale comes.

Fun Game to play With friends aside doing mission* I'm not Gonna lie I did Spent half of my Current Gameplay just Doing something Stupid with my friends Aside doing any mission in GTA online.Cons You may Run The game on ultra in single player with 60fps++*but in Multiplayer I suggest you change it little bit down well because it's onlineand it requires more than your system to play on Online Seriously believe me. Long Joining Session On online mode. *I have to say that this is the most anoying thing in this game it took me about 5 10 minutesbefore I can jump into online and everytime i want to do a heist I have to wait some other loading screen for like 3 minutes Each . Some ""Random"" Players*Imagine when you have your own business and suddenly you got blown up by random player. Microtransaction* R* really make something that didn't hit some player's Wallet. but for me They did why ? because If you want to unlock Something on This game especially for big Heist or any DLC updates. You have to Grind.I mean yes. Grinding like A LOT or you can just buy Shark Card Start From 10$ to 30$ (I forgot )to get Those Big Heist and others to unlocked Dont get me wrong .

1/1/2016,0,0,109,Recommended,First of all I love this game ... been a fan of the entire series since the very first game IV although one of the greats just didn't really click (insert hate comment here!) between Niko and the whole dating mechanics they somewhat lost me.This one however the game style seems more similar to what we used to get early on ... I have to agree with some reviewers that the game leaves you wanting more after the story wraps up in single player mode and that it becomes a true fan thing afterwards to push for gold on mission try to cause chaos or finish every single task in the game and push for achievements and that works for me so I m happy.I have just started playing Online initial thoughts looks good the newly added protection mechanism (disable something something where no one can shoot you I think it s called passive mode) seems to work or maybe it's just because I play in hours no one is online not sure but no complaints from me yet anyways!The 3 character theme heist the voice acting the style of missions the amount of details cramped into the beautiful city and now playing online I have enjoyed almost everything in this game and for me personally I couldn t get any game to get me hocked this much in a very long time (with a busy schedule) this one gets my vote for a full score and a recommendation to anyone to play this one,Grand Theft Auto V,4,109,1348,255,4

Spawning crap to block the road freezing you deleting your weapons (its temporary don't worry) spawning money (because everything is expensive) and also trying to crash your game by spawning alot of stuff if you want to report them.. could be better for the modding communityStill a great game and I think the number of hackers have reduced by now.,Grand Theft Auto V,3,44,1151,196,3

7/20/2014,0,0,160,Recommended,I awoke cold and naked. The sparse landscape of these rolling hills was vast with the smell of ocean air all around me. With nothing to protect myself from the dangerous wildlife I grabbed a rock that lay at my feet and began to survive. It was less than an hour before I came across a cavalcade of Chinese folk armed to the teeth stacked tightly and apparently laying claim to the surrounding area. I narrowly escaped notice fearing for my life and my rock. I managed to use my rock to kill a wild pig and scrape his insides for raw meat. I tanned the flesh to prepare for clothing and despite doing my best to clean it I could not escape the smell of the blood of what I had done.I fashioned a stone hatchet to gather resources at a faster pace as well as to better defend myself from any potential threat. I ran to hide in a rock formation nearby and managed to bump into a long time friend. I thought that I would never be able to find him in the vast surrounding. He had built a shelter so as we sat inside for the first night I shared the food I had earned with him in the dark so as not to attract any attention for the stalkers of the night.The next day we gathered what we could from the surroundings and decided to search for a place to establish a safe area to build a home. Ran through fields scared more of people than animals. Ran through forests scared of a single bear more than the packs of wolves. We happened upon some rusty abandoned structures. There seemed to be only dead things here. It didn't seem right so we agreed that it would be best to search these buildings as fast as possible. Death would be swift if something went wrong but if we didn't try death would be slow. Then without hesitation we scrambled throughout all the rooms swiftly and met back together in the safety of the mountains just outside the compound. I found a handgun with a few rounds and some clothes. He managed to find some more rounds a shotgun and the blueprints to construct a rifle.With my military training I kept the handgun because I could handle the accuracy needed for what little distance it could cover while he kept the shotgun to protect us from up close. We avoided contact with other humans as best as possible with the occasional Mexican standoff of both parties before either parting ways with agreed neutrality on rare circumstances or the more likely shoot out. On the times that we had to defend ourselves from other humans we knew that we had to do what we needed to survive and scavenged their bodies for anything useful. Usually the pickings were scarce. One guy actually came at us with only a rock. I shot him in the head as he ran screaming at me and immediately felt remorse and pity for what this man must have been through. At least he is no longer suffering.When we found a cliff along the ocean facing out into the west we decided this would be our home. Before the sun slid its fingers out of view we had barely managed to put up the shanty with a few barricades to hide us further from view so as to obscure all the light from our campfire. That second night we maintained vigilance well into the night but at least we had warmth. At least we managed to get some sleep.The start of our third day was before the sun rose and in the twilight we split up to complete different tasks to provide for one another. I crafted a bow and some arrows to go hunting for food while he stayed in the area collecting materials for a stronger home. A stronger base. Around noon I returned to find a large amount of wood piled up and ready to construct. I had killed a deer and a wild pig and managed to bring most of the bodies home after I had drained them of blood and internal organs. I left the meat to cook as we began to put together a real home with thicker walls a few rooms storage crates and some make shift sleeping bags to provide warmth through the night without the attention of a fire. We lived like this for quite some time until our lives were ended one night. A group of raiders had found us as we slept killed us and removed all traces of our lives from our home.I awoke cold and naked. Alone and lost. This was my life now. I had to start over and so did my friend but we would repeat the same patterns to survive and search for one another and all with the memories of what have happened to us. Over time I made new friends and came across long lost old friendships and our group grew. At first we lived separate from each other but as the trend of night raids increased we slowly congregated and constructed a fortress. Together a tower was constructed with layers of walls to slow the enemy from reaching our doorstep. If they had managed to make it inside our tower they would have to navigate the maze of halls and doors to find us. We thought we were safe. We ruled over all the land we could keep watch over but inside who watches the watchmen?,Rust,4,160,4890,931,4

12/24/2016,0,0,1739,Recommended,"For start I recommend it to everyone. It is not age restricted literally anyone can have fun with it. It's just like a sport. No money involved no ""pay to win"" / ""no pay no play"" an that stuff. Sure you can buy items to look better but no items affect the game. As I said it's like a sport meaning the more you practice the better you get so the game is fair and everyone is equal. Mostly for that reason I love it because the only thing that defines your skill is the number of hours played and practiced. Every match is 5 minutes of pure fun unless you're salty in which case I recommend you some fries instead of game lol. The only thing I dislike is community because the vast majority playes the mind tricks trying to get you angry so that you can't perform at best but that's not developer's fault so no problem there with the game itself just the people who can't really have fun. Remember it's a game it's meant to bring people together to smile together. If you're looking for fun and not being 100% competitive always this is a game for you!

3/17/2018,0,0,459,Not Recommended,"Original Comment Summary of the GamePlayerUnknown BattleGrounds or otherwise known as PubG is one of the most explosive games to come of all time. The Battle Royale genre has never been so enthusiastic about a game so large and free. The game that came out in Mid December of 2017 is a great game everyone should at least play a few times over. The shooting is done fantastic and could not be better with the current variety of weapons and the new scopes that came earlier this week as of March 2018. Their roadmap is fantastic and gives the players a resource to speculate the upcoming updates. The game is exciting at parts and dull at others but that was the intent for the design of the map. As well as the other 2 new maps coming in mid late 2018 and maybe in early 2019 from my speculation I am excited to see how this game will come through development in the coming years.Before 7/16/18 Rating7/10P.S.(If there are any typos please tell me. Thank you!)Didn't mean to make this a long review but sorry if it ended up being one. Had to go through all the major points in this game that I think are the most critical.More Critical Thoughts as of 7/16/18 Note Before whining in the comments below this is suprisingly my own opinionAs of late PubG has been by far one of the worst experiences for an avid gamer such as myself. Deciding on taking the route of EA PubG Corp wants to focus more on money than their own playerbase.Pros Sanhok This has easily been one of the most enjoyable maps I've played since the release of the game. This breathes a new feeling into the game in which every drop you do is a hotdrop or is filled with players. Not only does the map feel unique the devs actually listened to how the players wanted the map and enjoyed the feedback from the map. Lets hope the Winter Map does the same thing.Cons Battle Pass One of the largest disappointing ""content"" updates was the addition of the battle pass. Much like Fortnite's Battle Pass PubG offers less content and less cosmetics than what Fortnite's System does for a heavier price tag. The Battle Pass has had more issues than their own servers at this point and when it releases for the second time later down the road we can only HOPE for better. Desync I don't know how but god damn it PubG you sure ed up this time. Desync was an issue back when the gun changes released. Eventually they fixed it but boy o' boy do they sure hate their customers. I don't know which dev thought it was a great idea to add this back into the game but you obviously love shooting players behind walls you cheeky . Hit Registration Oh what to say what to say. This great peice of artwork is what happens when the devs are lazy enough to add the most simple mechanics from the UE into their own game. If you've played this game for more than 10 hours you'll know that hit registration in this game is utter t. Not only can you hit players in the hand and do mediocre amounts of damage but tihs can happen multiple times over the course of you just trying to win a gunfight. Bullet Blocking A system that was never introduced to this game even though they wanted to fix it over 6 months ago. I don't know why this system has yet to be tested or even made but if you want a balanced game you sure aren't doing it right. SMG Buff/b The weapon before the buff was already pretty good but now you want to add no recoil to the UMP and give it more damage? I thought the weapon balancing update was supposed to reduce overpowered weapons. Warmode This gamemode shows how out of touch the PubG devs are with their community by adding the same garbage gamemode back into the next week of ""content"". Just a sorry excuse for trying players to rejoin their game to give it another shot. Latency Server Sided Issue that I know can't be fixed instantly but this has been a problem since I've started playing back in December. Its unreal that they can let a problem go on for so long and have yet to be fixed. FPS/Stuttering This game is by far not for lower end systems. Hell I can barley play on a 1060 6GB. The FPS issue has been there since the beginning but has declined in the recent March update in which I hope they continue to improve as it can still be a problem here and there but overall it needs to be one of their number 1 priorities besides cheaters.After 7/16/18 Rating4/10As much as I enjoy this game for newer players coming into the game wait until the devs get their together and fix their game. As much as I love this game the devs break the game with every update and don't even attempt to fix the bugs anymore. These hotpatches that are half a gigabyte in size is an absolute joke and the way the PubG team is handling this game makes me sick. They imply they care but they are just slowly letting their game die off while Fortnite is actually trying new stuff even though I'm not into it. As much as PubG hates the customers this will still be one of the best experiences of a game before the Desync happened.(I will change my recommendation if they fix this game)",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,459,5035,947,1

4/24/2017,0,0,119,Not Recommended,"Product received for free. DO NOT BUY THE GAME!!!!!! Update This game has only gotten worse cheats have taken over this game more than they did H1Z1. Bluehole is another failed company using early access to line their pockets and putting out that should get them jailed.It's time this early access stopped it does nothing but produse bad games and give hackers and other cheats nothign but time to ruin things for others.There is no point in this game anymore so save your money and buy something else does not matter when the game is finished it wont be much different it will just lose the ""early access"" bull and roll over players taking their money and giving us nothing it's a trap like WoW H1Z1 Dayz and many more games.Reason 1) Cheats. Lots of them nothing being done. Yes yes I get it early access but no. Cheats run wild and BlueHole doesn't do anything.Yes you say Blue Hole asks you to report cheaters on forums and twitter... GREAT IDEA. We did this me and my friends two of them streamers on twitch. All four of us nice posted the way they asked streamers gave screen shots and their e mails to let the staff know they had VoD's of all this.less than an hour later all 4 of us banned from forums the streamers banned for life from the forums and from blue hole twitter. Talk about great support.There is other cheating going on. Lots people teaming up with friends in solo que. It is at the point where so many people team they don't even hide it cause Bluehole does nothing. We are talking about people riding in the same car or boat. Camping the same room in the same house or on the same hill fighting and looting together not hard to spot.This is so easy to spot but then again if you report you will more than likely be banned.Reason 2) As stated above BlueHole are Awholes.Reason 3) This one is not a big problem yet but will be down the line it will be a big problem for sure cause the hackers will take hold of this scam and make it a problem.The problem is currency farmers and does not harm much now but soon will be a problem like H1Z1 and CS GO.These are the people that join and then afk let the game start and just let their player get ejected from the plane when it's done flying over. They land and are either killed by other players camping their bodies or till the circle gets them and they get what ever currency they got.Or you have some one with multiple accts joins a game ( I usually see this in squads) They move all their players to a house or some hiding spot and wait till the games ends for them some how. I usually find them in out of the way places and are easy to pick off nice score booster. But the problem is many of these people do this for the game currency to buy crates or items and them put them up for sale on the steam auctions. Now you'll say this is harmless but when people can make real money from fake currency it's going to turn into a problem when they add more vanity items to the game and when they can make real money and turn to cheats to help them stay alive longer or what ever. In the end it's going to be a problem and it's not going to end well.Anyway those are the problems with the game. Sure all games have cheats but when the makers of the game blow it off and don't do anything about it you know it's just going to get worse and Bluehole and steam will cover it up and spit out t to scam cash off as many ppl as they can.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,119,3397,657,1

7/20/2015,0,0,323,Recommended,"This is an amazingly fun yet elegantly simple game.The short and sweet of it is that it's Soccer but with cars that can double jump and booster.PROS Elegantly simple easy to learnEntirely skill basedTeamwork feels naturalIncredibly intensely funNo DLC or microtransactions of any kind. I don't know about future plans but I love that in a gameCONS It's a team game so quitters are a thingLag when it was noticable (not often) was very much so because of the fast pace of the gameAs of writing no way to play in a party or communicate with my PS4 friendsI feel like I first have to mention that I am not a fan of racing games soccer or sports in general. Despite that I was hooked on this game in the first round. The simplicity means that you and up to 3 of your friends can pick it up any time and you wont have to explain any rules. This makes it a great local game to play to have a high energy intensely fun time. Competing against or cooperating with your friends are both equally enjoyable even as the losing team.Although the controls and rules are dirt simple the game has complexity and is deeply skill based. Moments that inspire ""Hell yeah!""s and ""Daaaayyyuuum""s are plenty and the replay feature that comes after every goal nearly always has something worth watching to show. Once I bought the game on my PC and played solo online I found difficulty surpressing loud shouts of glee and longed for an audience to see the many spectacular occassions that dot the experience of playing. Doing well feels so damn good and mistakes seem to slip away as the pace and intensity of the game consumes you.Teamwork seems to come naturally and with the exception of a bit too many rage quitters the online community was polite and surprisingly forgiving.It just feels good all around.

1/21/2018,0,0,286,Recommended,"I am updating my review since I returned to the game recently and many of my issues with this game have been cleared up. This by no means states that they have done EVERYTHING but they have done enough that I believe I can recommend this game now.The early game issues stated in my previous review have been lessened. I am now able to load in land and am much more likely to consider landing aggressively now that I can fight early on (most of the time).The circle has become signifanctly less of an overbearing problem with it's previous high speed short timer and heavy damage. The travel speed of the circle has been reduced significantly early on so it doesnt feel (as much) like you are just getting eternally f**ked by the circle. The timers have been altered somewhat as well. The damage is still as heavy as it was before but I am fine with that personally.I am very happy that the developers took the time needed in order to fix the vast majority of issues when it comes to cheating. I feel this has helped the health of the game in far many more ways than I believe the developers realized.This game feels far more like it is a released game especially with the recent addition with the ""event"" game modes which I absolutely love as a concept. I hope that this rotating game mode is constantly active and rotating between different modes rather than how some other games do their special modes. Example of this 'A special game mode but only on weekends'. I would much rather see each event mode be constantly available until a new/rotated event replaces it.I still have a few concerns and complaints however. The biggest complaint at the moment being the implementation of ""Teaming"" being a reportable offense. While I can somewhat understand this being implemented for pros and streamers. I find that this takes away from what makes PUBG organic. If 2 squads of people meet in the battlegrounds and instead of instantly shooting eachother decide to make a peace and work together until the final battle I believe they should be able to. The threat of betrayal is always present and they will have to fight eachother eventually. Added on top of the extremely low chance of 2 groups have friends happening to be in the same game together. This seems like a negative aspect on something that would make the game far more interesting all because of the very few.Lastly something I didn't consider but am pleasently surprised about. With the rise of other games taking away some of PUBG's spotlight this game has started developing an interesting lax and fun community. I have been having a lot more fun playing this game with random people rather than just my friends. I believe this is the shining point for me to enjoy playing this game again.Overall I believe this game is now worth buying. I just hope the continue to improve and fix the issues I have that have yet to be addressed.I left my previous review intact below.Previous Review(""I love this game. I honestly do. I really want this game to do well but it first needs to do better. There are more bugs and issues with this game than modern day Triple A titles.""""The early game being one of the most painful experiences you can have.First you get stuck because the parachute fails to register that you landed. Then wait there for 3 5 seconds until the game decides to give you mercy and allow you to cut the line. After is a rapid run to grab guns that the game is unable to register being picked up. There is nothing more frustrating than being on a time restraint and clicking 17 times to pick up a gun that only appears in your inventory after death. Not to mention the intense latency that occurs in any early game combat.""""General issues such as randomly dying while walking and the game claiming you ""died by falling"" and being randomly ejected from a moving vehicle.""""I also have several issues with things like the circle but that is much more understandable and necessary.""""I don't feel like going too deep into the loot boxes but I do feel like the latest 'key required' box heavily pushes a cash grab image.""""This game should not be released from early access in its current state. All praise from people that are happy that it came out of early access are people that just have a bad taste for the title ""Early Access"".""""Bottomline I can not recommend this game at this time. Not until some of these blatant problems are solved in at least some capacity.""""Side note there are still many issues that I don't have on my mind at the time of writing this review but I will be interested in updating this when something significant occurs."")",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,286,4615,823,5

Runs very smoothly after a few graphic tweaks. Fun online hunting component. Epic open landscapes to explore each very unique and well designed. So much depth in crafting/forging/cultivating/cooking seems a little overwhelming at first. Lots of hidden features secrets &amp nuances in all aspects of the game. Very satisfying gameplay loop of killing Monsters which can take anywhere up to an hour then using the materials to better yourself and hunt bigger Monsters.Very highly recommended.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,49,651,99,3

8/14/2018,0,0,147,Recommended,Scroll down for TL DR summary.So as a heads up there are currently big connection issues with this game. I'll get this out of the way if you want to play Multiplayer hold onto your money. You may even want to look into some of the other issues with this game as for some it doesn't even run. (There is a Fan made fix out for several of these but not the connection issues )Besides these glaring issues this game is a flawed masterpiece. Once it gets patched it'll be worth every penny especially when they fix the server issues. Again if you want Multiplayer don't buy this YET. If you want single player though hoo boy are you in for a wild ride. This game is one of the most addictive things I've played in years. I may be a little biased being a long time Monster Hunter Veteran but this game is just wonderful. Great combat great customization lots of stuff you can do. Overall an extremely good waste of your time. If you're cool with doing Solo while waiting for Multiplayer to be fixed this game is a must buy in my opinion.TL DR Bad Servers Fantastic Game Questionable port.

Game is fun though when people actually join heist and when you are atleast lvl 50 online. gta 5 the actual story is decently good but GTAIV is a much better game. Seriously though the ing oading screens kill me. I completely walk away from my computer every time it has to load and do something else because they take that long. However when the game isnt loading it is very fun to play even though Rock Star Games have become very jewish and is trying to make it a pay to win type of game with shark cards.

2/21/2016,0,0,1999,Not Recommended,"GTA 5 Online makes me think it must be designed by malicious or mentally challenged farm animals and it is by far the worst large scale online game I have ever played (I've played lots of games.) I dont recommend anyone buying *anything* from rockstar games at this rate they deserve to go out of business.The game has a story mode and an online mode. Story mode should take you about a week to finish I guess and it's fun but if you feel the need to do more together with intelligent beings prepare to get annoyed. Its online mode is by far the worst online game I have ever played not because it's not fun to play but many mechanics leading to having a good time in this game is so terribly designed it wastes more than half your game time. You'll be cursing its developers a lot if you buy this like I did. Also the way the game deals with leavers griefers cheaters and other plainly unintelligent ppl is... well the game doesn't deal with them. You do. You'll have to sort through hundreds of undesirables to find a handful you can play with.Some problems with GTA5 Online 1) There are some types of instances you can join public / friends only / crew only. When you first boot up the game it either loads into story mode or an online public instance. If you want to join a private instance you can only do that after it loads into story mode. I prefer loading crew only instances in online mode loads fast. In there after you accept a job invitation and finish the job the game usually puts you in a public instance with murderous characters and cheaters instead of the type of *private* instance you were in. (I've seen 20 players getting continuously teleported to a spot and getting bombed continuously which is not something a player can normally do btw and makes the user interface just block your controls and you won't even be able to report anything. What's *cheating* in an online game anyway right? Rockstar allows it. They suck.)Instead it should put you back in the type of instance it took you from while you joined others to do a job. Or it should ask you wth you want to do now. So what ends up happening is it tries to put you in an instance with 20 people in it which takes way longer to load than your solo instance then you quit online mode to be able to select an instance type again then it says ""Leaving instance.."" you wait then it loads into story mode automatically then you select the type of instance you wanna get into in the online mode again and finally go back to where the game should have sent you in the first place after wasting like 3 4 mins every ffing time (unless it even fails at that saying ""failed to find a suitable instance"" and loads back into story mode again.)All this unnecessary and outrageously long loading business eats up all your game time. It could easily be avoided by letting the users decide what to load.2) In the online part first you appear in the same world that's in story mode with some minor changes. That's called ""free mode"". You may do some stuff in free mode steal cars drive around rob shops beat up pedestrians take your shiny new tank for a test drive start a 5 star cop chase / rampage etc. The point is you may be doing something there. While in free mode you get job invitations to your phone from other players and npcs. You try to join those and most of the time it just unloads your current freemode instance without checking if you can actually join that (yes ""most of the time"" because sometimes it even fails at that after making you wait for about a minute) The game immediately takes you to loading screens saying ""Leaving instance..."" ""Joining instance..."" ""That job is now full of players"" ""Loading..."" ""Loading..."" And then you watch your apartment building's side wall for 10 secs and then you finally appear in your apartment and watch useless game notifications (which block your ability to start a heist btw) saying ""You can redesign your interior decorations"" etc every time before you can restart a heist.Instead it could and should first check if the job you're trying to join is full or not before jumping to all those needless loading screens then reserve a place for you there and only then make your game client leave the game instance you're in to safely join that other one.3) In the online part jobs/heists/races etc have a *number of players* restriction. For instance for a typical heist you need 4 people and if one of them leaves while you're in there the game disbands the whole team even if you're 5 seconds away from success. And the game automatically takes you back to free mode where you can start from the beginning finding people.If there aren't any mission specific tasks left that the leaver still has to accomplish it should just let you go on instead. Or in any case it should at least take you back to the part where you're just about to start the mission. Then you'd only be looking for one more player instead of 3 more which usually takes forever mind you. It has so much good and fun content (voice actored characters stories cutscenes land water and air vehicles jobs etc) which would put this game in the definitely buy list if it wasn't for the numerous design problems about which I can almost say ""show me something in there I'll tell you something wrong with it"" Ofc I don't care to explain everything while Rockstar apparently isn't even in the business of fixing stuff (years old bugs still there) or doing things correctly in the first place so there isn't much point in hoping it'll ever get better either.So long story short in the online mode 1) Your 20 mins of perfect runs or any other effort will get wasted because someone leaves intentionally or due to server issues *so many times* that you'll give up looking for people.2) You'll end up watching the game waste your time with needless loading screens making you try to join jobs you cannot taking you places which you'll leave.Obviously this game's developers are as malicious or as stupid as they come making such game breaking simple design mistakes... You'll end up trying to join jobs you actually can't hundreds of times and waste many hours looking at stupid loading screens. Anyone with mediocre intelligence would think of the design faults that lead to the above mentioned problems and correct them before even publishing them. So don't buy this cr p if you're buying for online play and you don't have a bunch of guys from irl you can play with.Oh yea btw currently the game doesn't let you play the offline ""story"" mode unless you have an internet connection you can connect to steam with. It used to let you play offline in story mode with steam in offline mode but now it says it cant connect to rockstar servers you need an internet connection to ""activate"" your product. You used to only need to activate it once to play offline later on but they apparently changed that now. Totally sux balls.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,1999,6904,1252,1

6/15/2017,0,0,472,Not Recommended,"In the world of disconnected executives it probably sounded like a really good idea to remove mod support. It probably looked good in a spread sheet and in a power point presentation. It probably sounded really good in the ears of the corporate zombies that are completely removed from their customers. The oportunity to make a couple of thousand extra dollars is just to tempting for them to take a step back and ask themselves ""Guys is this REALLY a good idea?"".And no it was the worst decision they have ever made. By far. So bad infact that if there was a zombie apocalyptic outbreak in the Take Two's HQ it would actually increase the average IQ. It would probably improve the customer expererience and interaction as well.We are talking about tools that are targeted towards the single player mode only. A mode that has been left completely unsupported since the launch. No new missions no added campaigns. No nothing. Enter the modders that VERY LIKELY has had a significant impact on the sales since tens of thousands gamers are watching Youtubers and streamers mess around with added content. Content that people clearly like but the publishers have been completely ignoring. Why? Probably because the online part is easier to monetise on since you get to buy Shark cards due to the ridiculous pricing of the added content for the online mode. I for one couldn't be arsed with the online mode at all any more. But that is a completely different story.The trend in the business at the moment are going towards 2 things 1. Coop2. Mod supportMore and more AAA titles are incorporating systems for modders to publish their work. And we are talking work out of pure love of the game since they make zero US pesos on it. Not only are these modders increasing the life span of the games but they are also getting more people to buy the them. FACT! I'm one of them since I've purchased several Sim racing games only becuase they have had extra (MODDED!) content that I really wanted to try. And now they suddenly decided to chop of that hand that has been feeding them money. Feeding them money for FREE!There's problaby some guy in the marketing department completely unaware of how gamers think of course that came up with the idea and managed to pitch it to the board. And that's fine of course but how the board decided that it was a great idea and also how they are actually going to make MORE money out of cutting out the mod support is completely beyond me. It's probably due to the fact that I can't think like a zombie but who knows.I completely agree to having a hard red line against modding in the online part since we are talking about real money that gets involved. I have zero sympathy for cheaters e t c so that's not an issue for me.But since we are talking about the single player offline mode it's just too much to swallow.I'm only one voice the gaming universe but for me this means that it will be no RDR2 for me.

7/12/2015,0,0,15,Recommended,Have you ever watched any of the Top Gear episodes where they play football with cars? If not stop reading and go watch one now! If you have then imagine that but at 4 times the speed with cars that can jump and boost to even more ludicrous speeds in an arena where driving on the walls is not only allowed but encouraged! This game is pure no nonsense balls to the wall fun whether you like football or not (I don't much like it personally) you will have a lot of fun with this. The handling of the cars of just the right level of arcadey fun that you always feel in control and you very quickly get to grips with the camera which does about as good a job as it can trying to keep up with the ball! Once you have the basics of the game down there are plenty of tricks you can pull to keep the ball away from the opponents and going toward their goal. On top of these there is lots of neat car customization which includes the usual decals flags wheels and boost smoke colour and of course the hats! Hey it works for TF2 so why not put a hat on your car )There are a couple of modes exhibition and season vs the AI which is the best way to start playing until you start to figure out how stuff works and then there is the online mode.

You'll find yourself alone constantly. Rockstar doesn't give half a about hackers and instead ban people using FOV mods.7/10)Now for my new review You done ed it up Take Two. You destroyed single player modding. You don't even devellop single player anymore. It's dead.Not the ing online tho. Wheter the Bans are false or not is meaningless.The Online is filled with hackers. You don't stop them you just add more stupid game modes that nobody gives a about.You killed modding.

At times it can be a little frustrating when you land on a map and there are no weapons anywhere in sight but after playing it for a bit you start to learn where the good stuff is often located.

3/31/2017,1,5,2,Not Recommended,I was hoping for this game to be the ultimate battle royale game but I think PLAYERUNKNOWN and his asian dev team bit off a bit more than they can chew.THE GRAPHICS Long story short this game is not a looker. I run everything at 2K on ultra but still the graphics are mediocre and the design choices are nothing special at all. It's like they just decided slavic name y towns and cities are survival themed so they went with it. Character customization is pretty much non existant with very limited choices in different models of hair and the likes. Even the clothing options are limited with only 2 jackets with 5 skins in total. This means every character you meet will look like the other one you just got shot by.The map is not up to standards with todays other games. The scale is off with roads being maybe up to 3 times the size of a normal road so they could fill the map more. The landscape has no real life to it with a severe lack of bushes rocks and difference in terrain height something that is even more noticeable with the washed out and lifeless grass textures. Things are pretty samey aswell when it comes to construction you will see buildings being repeated and small details like most doors looking the same. In graphics and design the tiny details matter and I'm not familiar with the development teams previous games but it looks like they don't have the creative art &amp design department to think of something intresting and original.THE GAMEPLAY It's OK. It's nothing new if you have ever played H1Z1 ArmA or Rust's Battle Royales. Once you go through the small amount of lootable weapons there are in the shipping of the early access theres only the PvP perspective left to the game. Which is quite enjoyable but hindered by a bad FOV (It's pretty bad if you look down your head is in your chest.) meaning you try to use 3rd person as often as possible. This brings the review to the fatal flaw of the game so far which is the implementation of 3rd person. You will always be able to win through hiding in grass and behind buildings using 3rd person to look over the obstacles. The person who is moving is more than often the one who loses any fight. The gameplay is therefore slowed down to a crawl in some moments with no one wanting to show themselves. I've heard roumors about a first person only server but I dont know if theres any confirmation. It's the same problem that plauged ArmAs BR until people started enforcing first person only on their servers.The game is basically an inbetweener of ArmA and H1Z1 with the good sides and bad sides of both. Im guessing if you like both you'll find this game an alright game to play with friends. If you really like either one you will be fanny flustered about having to deal with the flaws of another game.FINAL RATING 4/10Atrocious creative work with a bland unoriginal game setting. Too much emphasis on gameplay without dealing with the flaws of either of the two games that PLAYERUNKNOWN previously worked on. The gameplay is still alright though meaning the game does have alot of potential but it's probably too late in the development to change any of its major flaws. I'll keep an eye out on this game to see if it ever changes it's course but for now I see no reason to play it.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,2,3267,597,1

1/15/2014,0,0,202,Recommended,A lot of people have issues with the game but honestly it's not that bad. Just picking the right server can honestly make all the difference. The bigger servers are plagued with hackers and people who will kill you on sight. Even if you do get established you're liable to be raided. Playing with friends can alleviate that problem and make for some epic raids and gun fights. I personally enjoy playing on smaller servers and building with friends. I actually run a server because I enjoy playing it so much and hated to see other admins abusing their power and servers that did nothing about hackers.If you get the game find a low pop/instant craft server and you'll have a ton of fun. Once you get started and growing it becomes quite addictive. I'm actually working on a guide w/ videos to help people get started and learn the map. More maps are coming new items areas a chopper all sorts of things. I'm really excited for this game and will stick with it until it's release. Also make sure to check the wiki and other sites for help on crafting and other things. You are dropped in with no knowledge of what to do or how to play so it'd be good to watch a video or two to get acclimated.,Rust,5,202,1193,223,5

12/26/2017,0,0,49,Recommended,"Gameplay is average. Probably significantly better with friends but I have none of those. Decent performance on my hardware (See profile) but do be expected as the graphics aren't the best. Cons There is no matchmaking. Your rank is irrelevant and is not taken into consideration properly. It's pretty much just if you are 10 or below you are matched with 10 or below. Considering this game has 20K+ players most of the time THIS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.Second thing. PEER TO PEER. STOP IT. Half of the matches have 200+ ping so you just lag around and eventually die because of it. Either this is the matchmaking to blame matching me with foreign players or most of the players hosting have internet. Please add a filter so i can filter out lobbies with 100+ ping. Third. Developers can't seem to make up their mind who has the advantage. So with every update they might give survivors or killers a significant buff or an insane perk or they might do the opposite and nerf one side into the ground. Fourth. The devs just spent their time making cosmetics to sell so they can not only bathe in money like they currently areBut now they'll have enough money to wallpaper their house with it too. (""BuT yOu DoN't HaVe To BuY iT"" you say Clearly missed my point)tl dr The game really isn't that good. I'm not going to give it a negative rating because the problems lie mainly with the developers and the cancerous community not the game (Worse than League or CSGO this takes the cake for me) But unless it's on sale or you have 3 friends (I don't) then don't bother.",Dead by Daylight,3,49,1557,283,3

Welcome back!It has A WORLD of content it still gets regularly updated with new things it's active and there's a lot to do. You are very likely to encounter hackers sooner or later but you can just switch lobbies or play with your friends (it's fantastic when you get a crew to roll with) or even alone. You create a character customize it dress it up as you like you level up by doing stuff shooting stealing racing killing heisting the good stuff you name it. As you level up you unlock loads of stuff to do and play with properties to buy like safehouses and garages businesses to generate more cash more missions vehicles clothes tatoos hairstyles etc.You have stats for shooting driving flying underwater breathing but all that is improved through playing and never really degrades so unless you're really obsessive about it you needn't pay much attention to it.Regarding the single player aspect it's fantastic lots of stuff to do three protagonists to play as the missions are varied and wacky in true GTA style. PC gets first person too which is a damn fine addition to an already very polished game.The only literal bad thing are the loading times but if you can stand that (through SSD or sheer patience) you're golden.

We know you love running so much that every 3 steps you take forward you go 6 back.And don't you worry we know you want to run in style so we will have multiple skins for sale you can gamble for. We will release 10 skins but you will pay for the same one over and over again due to awesome rng from our loot crates.I bet that video you saw was impressive (winter map trailer) but dont worry that only took us 3 years to make. We will release a simpler version on our potato engine that all early 1990 Nokias can run at a whopping 5 fps.

Online is fine although ""Shark Cards"" are being basically shoved down peoples throats at this point. Good Sides to Singleplayer Good Storyline Good Gameplay Good Sides to Online Its freaking multiplayer GTA. (Though limited due to the heavy increase in the need of shark cards to really do anything anymore. )Bad Sides to Storymode Bland after you complete the story really. Mods have been called ""Illegal"" by the games publisher and they have even went so far as to shut down singleplayer mods entirely by killing OpenIV.... Bad Side of Online Microtransaction HEAVY (if you dont want to spend your life grinding missions on loop for days on end making around 9 15 k when mostly everything cool costs like 8 9 million GTA$.. ""Thats $99 for a 8 million GTA$ shark card By the way.... "") No mods (Not even in private sessions) Little to no replay value once you are high level Rampant cheating..

Some of the main selling points as to why this is one of my main games is that it requires skill there is a lot to learn and you can play it with friends!! Many games have the same things of course but with monster hunter being able to read the monsters attack or being able to buffer your attack and feeling your attack on the monster as you perfectly calculate your attacks are extremely rewarding for a player.Great game for individuals teams and friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,46,571,106,3

9/7/2016,0,0,78,Recommended,Asymmetrical multiplayer games are becoming much more popular lately and this is probaly my favorite. Whether playing as killer or survivor the game doesn't feel one sided. While the survivors have the advantage early due to numbers as the match goes on surviving becomes much more difficult as you become a target. The only problems I found with the game are perks and skill based match making. Perks are either obtained by leveling your charecter or drops starting the game with none a new player is possibly at a disadvantage based on luck though I feel perks don't usually determine a match. As with skill based match making there is none. A new player can be easily intimidated by a level 20 hunter as players are thrown in a first come first served basis. Other than that the game feels very balanced and makes a great time either playing with randoms or friends.,Dead by Daylight,3,78,869,153,3

Currently the game has some optimization that needs to be made but all in all the game runs smoothly. Those familiar with Monster Hunter will know how oddly complicated the multiplayer functionality is but once you are familiar with the game mechanics you won't even think about it and will be playing with friends in no time.I've noticed most downvotes to this game are from people who are rating extremely harshly over one issue irrelevant to core gameplay.

Usually how it goes is that you can buy lootboxes for cosmetic items or play enough and recieve in game currency to buy them. I've always felt that system was fair for multiplayer games.

5/18/2018,0,0,385,Recommended,I found GTA V to be an enjoyable experience I found GTA Online to be both interesting and fun to play though just like any other online game the grinding just doesn't feel worth it even more angering was the ability to purchase shark cards to skip all the wait after having already purchased GTA V. I also found that GTA Online has many feautres that I felt should be added to singleplayer as without the storyline singleplayer seems quite barren and once you are rich there seems like there is nothing to do which is highly dissapointing. Back to GTA Online I felt GTA Online was constantly rushing me to blow millions that I didn't have yet pushing me torwards shark cards for example the phonecalls you get every time you login asking you to purchase something as well as the emails telling me it's the deal of a lifetime yet I get it every single time I login. GTA Online also genuinly seems like it tries to make ways to make money boring and repetitive without being too obvious. If you remove the blatant Shark Card advertising the constant modders annoying legit players common internet trolls the mundaneness of singleplayer the slow loading even on a top of the line PC and the constantly rising prices of GTA Online I would say GTA V &amp GTA Online were enjoyable experiences that will definetly have me coming back for more though I do wish Rockstar Norh would listen to its fans for once. I do not belive GTA V (Including GTA Online) is worth $60. I would pay $30 for GTA V (Including GTA Online) which I did. Do I recommend this game? Yes.,Grand Theft Auto V,5,385,1554,285,1

If you like being trolled unmercifully then by all means go ahead and get your own copy of the game. It's just a complete wast of time to gather the necessary materials to build a base only to have 3 or 4 players slaughter you take everything and destroy your base. You literally end up with nothing and have to start all over only to have it all taken away again and again. I've uninstalled this garbage called a game.

But seriously what the hell is with all the cheaters in this game lately? At least two of the games I've played in the last few days have been ended early by someone who was absolutely transparently hacking. A few others looked suspicious but I can't be sure. Reported them through the system and hopefully that helps in some small way but the devs need to get this under control. Fans are losing patience.

You either gun down that entire squad at military base single handed or you get aimbotted with a P92 by a Chinese player in Rozhok. Take the game as it is with a pinch of salt. It's a fantastic battle royale experience without the polish. Don't leave a bad review because your vehicle flipped over and killed you in a top ten situation when you could just as easily appreciate the outweighing amount of enjoyable and intense moments that the game brings to the table and go away feeling good about your purchase.Ultimately it needs some work but regardless it's a great game.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,246,735,133,5

Here's a tip when reading Steam reviews to help decide whether or not to purchase said game... Ignore any negative review where the person has played 100+ hours of the game. Nobody spends that much time playing a ""bad"" game. These people just have no social lives outside of gaming.

This is only the start of the problems with this mess of a game the next problem is the crashing I swear every 5th update this game has makes you crash on launch and their solution is a 50mb megabyte update every single day and 5 15gb update every mounth making thing game basically impossible to play on data.

12/20/2017,0,0,605,Not Recommended,Despite all the issues regarding cheaters performance issues and the developers' lack of timely effort to address these problems since the game was released I think it's a really fun game that will make you wanting to play more. Every round the outcome will always be different which makes it such an addictive game. Playing on a team (duo/squad) makes it a lot mroe fun and engaging and recommend playing with friends. Playing with randoms however you bear the risk of teaming up with non english speakers (especially players within the AS region) who just love spamming the mic with Mandarin in whatever PC cafe they are in. Annoying as . For those looking to purchase the game please keep up to date with the latest reviews and see what fixes have already been implemented or lack thereof and make your decision then. See you on the battlegrounds!Edit Came here to change my recommendation. Too many cheaters. I'm not talking once in a while. It's gotten to the point where at LEAST half of your games there will be a guarantee hacker.

8/3/2017,0,0,459,Recommended,"Rust is a good enough game as it is. If you like multiplayer ""survival"" games that features base building and PVP/E the I would recommend this game for you. Pros Intricate base building system. Rewarding loot system. Game is constantly improved as developers continue to work on the game. Easy to learn fast paced gameplay. Gunplay is like no other very smooth and rewarding. Always something to do in game.Cons The community is awful. You will most likely find no mercy from rival players. Unoptimized for weaker builds. The game is still early so this is a given and it is being worked on extensively. Has a heavy emphasis on cooperation. You'll have a harder time playing this by yourself than with a partner.All in all I've thoroughly enjoyed this game in my 300+ hours playing it I've had a lot of fun playing alone and with friends. It can be infuriating at times but sometimes the spark of randomness you can get from the community can be extremely hilarious. The game can be intense during gunfights or raids which is my personal drive for playing the game but can also be very frustrating when losing a battle or siege (which happens more often than I'd like to admit).Overall I would give this game a solid 8/10 as I've been a long time fan of it from 2013 I'm sure I have some level of bias.",Rust,5,459,1302,236,5

Using every advantage you can to survive and come up on top in this post apocalyptic Battle Royal style arena.The gun play is wonderfully satifying and the unreal engine allows for good reactive shooting with very little latency.The game is beautiful if you ever want to be at a disadvantage while playing on ultra but even on low it can be very enjoyable to look at.CONS The resource hunger of this game is insatiable. It want to use all of the system ram then move it into the vram while hitting your CPU like some sort of deranged video encoder. But after the first minute of dropping frames and unreactive doors the game runs smoothly.

You could even do that.And now Take Two wants to bury that in the sand and consider it ""Illegal.""You know what? The base game wasn't that fun either. It got old FAST.

So basically the modding scene was the only reason I ever played this game after I finished it. I liked playing around with what people came up with. And now I guess that's illegal?

You can't connect to a server if you are over 200 ping. It won't work for you.This on the other hand they allow everyone to connect from anywhere.

This game being in alpha stages still provides an amazing game I love how the game doesn't have too many deaths trying to learn and it isn't rare to die either. Also when you die you arenot forced to start over or spend an hour trying to find your body because of death beacons. Honestly this game easily matches the price in my opinion and has PLENTY of room to expand. The other planets allow one save to have dozens of bases even on larger planets you could have atleast 4.

6/19/2017,0,0,483,Not Recommended,"Grand Theft Auto V was pretty much that game that pretty much freed me of my bordem. Playing it on console was nice and all playing through the story a bunch of times but eventually I got bored of it. So once I bought this game on PC I was thinking ""It's just gonna be the same process over again so why not spice up the experience with a few mods"". So pretty much I was trying out addon vehichles trainers (Menyoo more specifically) and just simply goofing around. But one day I was planning on adding a favorite car in the game and OpenIV needed an update. I was actually hyped about it until I saw the message of OpenIV being forced to stop the project due to T2 cease and desist letter. I somewhat cried after seeing that mostly because it felt like my fun experience was simply taken from not only me but from many of the players who were also cranking up their fun on GTA V. So until I can have fun once again on GTA V I'm not changing my review and I'm not gonna uninstall OpenIV until justice is served.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,483,1011,197,1

6/6/2016,0,0,662,Not Recommended,"Let me give you a quick lowdown of GTA and the history of GTA.GTA was released on PC fairly late I think we all know this. The online was meh but it was always meh. Free updates is okay but hey you know free is free. however there's a twist with this. Where as a big game like Battlefield 4 back in its hayday DLC wasnt free. however paying for DLC would certainly cost less than GTA's proposed updates. You pay $20 get content. Simple. GTA you need to grind. You will not advance in the game until you grind. You must grind. If you dont want to grind you have to shovel cash into Rockstars pocket. This will only get you the barebones of what you want.Even then online is a hellhole. Most of everyone said "" paying for cash"" (for good reason) and have gotten money from scripters who cheat in cash. And even then scripters run rampid and normally unopposed. They dont have any retribution for banning people no backlash for anything.to simply put it GTA O is a cool concept yes. But milks the fact you the person who enjoys the content of GTA O Also doesnt have the time to farm in GTA O. So you're more likely to pay or try to find a scripter who may potentially ban you instead of well. Grinding. Grinding is terrible. It's hair pulling annoyance. It's repetitive. Every issue with it is just obvious.While I do applaud the content of GTA O it simply plays you the player like a fiddle if you want to play it ""Legit"" If you dont? You risk getting banned. Even if you get the cash from a scripter and dont report it there's still a tiny chance of getting banned permanently from the games servers. Which they've changed their policies ridiculously.Once again GTA O is just a of cool content and terrible management. Now I will say this. I wouldnt mind paying $20 towards the game if the game gave me more money and not just a 3% of any money I need to accomplish anything. I think we all would. Even then the game is poorly optimized I'm told.Singleplayer is cool storys neat all wraps up. If you want my advice though Just play Singleplayer with mods. We fought Two Take hard to get Open IV back (which enables you to swap between normal GTA and Modded GTA to prevent getting banned in GTA O for mods) Because singleplayer with mods is more enjoyable than online. Online is impossible to enjoy anymore.Dont support Rockstars bad habbit. Dont buy shark cards. If you dont pay them money in micro transactions they'll either abandon them Or improve them.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,662,2455,455,1

Anyway my teacher sent me to the principal's office. I told him what happened and he laughed too.

8/25/2018,0,0,97,Recommended,This game is a blast to play.Just so happens that a large portion of my friends (+ friends of friends) also bought this game and we have our own teamspeak channel set up. Very fun as a casual social game. If I was playing it purely solo (well only interacting with strangers online) I'm not sure how I'd feel about it.I hate the cutscenes and how non skippable they are. What is this nonsense about friends unable to join my storyline quest (or vice versa) until a special cutscene has completed? All I want to do is bash some monsters with my friends. Nobody plays Monster Hunter for the storyline let's be serious. Think of how people would revolt if a Super Smash Bros game shoved non skippable storyline cutscenes down their throats it would be awful.Looking past that (which in the grand scheme of things is pretty inconsequential but slightly annoying) I would highly recommend this as a social game to play with friends.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,97,927,165,3

8/24/2017,0,0,1047,Recommended,"Let me start off by saying this game is amazing hands down.I clearly have a ton of hours on this game and for the most part I thoroughly enjoyed each and every one. After I started mechanic school along with my full time job I realized I had less time to play so I started playing modded servers with slightly increased gather rates so that I could still enjoy the game to the fullest but spend less time. Unfortunately servers wipe every week or every other week or if you are on a very unpopular server maybe even a month. I say unpopular for the month wipe servers because the game dies every single wipe usually about a week in that is why the weekly wiped servers are by far the most popular and most played. If you don't have at least 2 4 hours (depending on your luck/skill) to play consecutively then do not buy this game. When you log off your character goes to sleep on the ground and you are basically free loot. You MUST build a base upon starting on a new server or fresh wipe. This games main problem is how time consuming it is to be able to have fun (IMO) I'm honestly not sure how they would even fix that without completely changing the game so I'm not complaining about it I'm just forewarning anyone on the fence about buying this game If you do not have a solid chunk of time to dedicate to this game on a daily basis you shouldn't buy this game. If you have 4 6 hours straight of each day you need to occupy Look no further you found the perfect game. On a side not for anyone that is going to buy this game It is competitive and cut throat if you think you're going to join a server and find help then think again. You will spawn in naked with a rock and see someone with a gun and a huge base and think ""awesome this guy can probably help me out and give me some starter quot WRONG! He is going to waste 40 bullets on you for some unknown reason just so you can re spawn naked with a rock to repeat the same process in front of some other s base.all in all 10/10",Rust,5,1047,1986,392,5

7/17/2015,0,0,64,Recommended,This game is like crack cocaine with some caveats. One only play online. Playing the single player campaign while good for practice ends up being really boring and will over inflate how good you think you are. You aren't. Two server issues. I live in Asia and its a right nightmare having to deal with the ping when playing the US EU and Oceania servers. Especially in a game like this where it's extremely important to aim and line up your flight path with the ball (yes flight path. rarely do i find myself driving). Now that we're done with the bad what does this game do good? Its a simple game with simple easy to understand controls and straightforward gameplay mechanics. Normally this will make for a terrible boring game but in this case the game excels for one reason. Its incredibly difficult to master. You might watch Kronovi do some insane cross field aerial volley while going backwards and think ah that doesnt look to hard I can do that. And then you can't. And end up hitting an own goal instead. Goddamit Carl. Now I've wasted enough time explaining this game. TL DR if you're looking for a fun game with short rounds that you can just pick up and play and that has a burgeoning multiplayer scene this is for you.,Rocket League®,3,64,1232,225,3
12/11/2013,0,0,77,Recommended,"This game is about survival but it is not your average DayZ or Minecraft type of game. The world is a post apocalptic wasteland with pockets of radiation zones scattered about. You are a survivor who must collect items and build your self a home where you can rest easy. There are other players who will be out to hunt you down and loot your stuff while there will be some who might be more friendly than others. Try and meet up with friendlies to help your odds of making it out there. The beginning of the game might seem like a pain to understand at first but once you get a feel of the crafting and resource gathering you will become a natural at it. This game is not the most fun to play alone so please bring friends with you. All ""noobs"" and legitmate players should take advantage of the offical servers to avoid admin abuse and hacking. Finally this is an Alpha game so don't expect it to be flawless. Now get out there and go kill some piggies and gather some wood for your home! Good luck out there!Summary for those who don't like long reviews Great game so far for an Alpha release. Get it now for $20 guys and come survive with me!

8/16/2018,0,0,63,Not Recommended,40+ hours into the game and i would say about 50% of it was dealing with connection issues. Just spent about an hour and a half doing 5 quests hunting Anjarath on High Rank to get disconnected every single time. It doesnt help that the monster scales up when you're in a party but if you get disconnected it doesn't scale back down. Which means you're left fighting a monster meant for a 4 party group all by yourself. Dealt with the exact same issue earlier today hunting Rathalos as well. Playing this game would be alot more awarding and satisfying if you didn't have to deal with constant dc issues every 10 minutes into a quest. Until they fix this issue i honestly dont see the point in even playing this game. If i wanted a single player game then i would've bought one simple as that.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,63,792,148,1

A bit CPU heavy but running an i5 4670 it runs just fine.Yes the game is difficult but it requires you to think and pay attention if you do that you're generally fine. This isn't your run in and spam m1 action rpg.Environments are great monster designs are absolutely amazing and they match where they're found generally. I've enjoyed every minute of this game so far I know it gets harder as you go through the story and that's where the game really begins so I can't wait for that.Online connectivity is hit or miss at best but I'm assuming they're working on that. Either way soloing stuff isn't a huge issue either it just takes longer.Victories are satisfying and deaths are rarely a BS scenerio this is the type of RPG I've personally been waiting for forever.

7/27/2018,0,0,83,Not Recommended,For those of you who still haven't heard of this game (I know there can't be many of you). I want you to watch the most recent trailer and notice how no one is hitting anyone. Well that sums up this game entirely. People always talk about the loot boxes or the asset flip and NON of that matters. If a game is fun then it's fun. The loot boxes are cosmetic only and I don't see any issues there. However the gunplay in this game is horrible. I understand they were going for a more realistic feel but being someone who used to train people to shoot I can tell you that is not an accurate way to portray realism. You can have your crosshairs on a stationary target burst firing and still hit nothing. I have run into situations where I had a shotgun at point blank range miss and vise versa I have had people shooting at me with a shotgun two inches from me and I was able to kill them with an m16. The gunplay in this game feels inconsistent and clunky for a game that revolves around you killing other people. Fixing the gunplay would skyrocket this game to the top and keep it there.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,83,1085,211,1

9/3/2017,0,0,38,Not Recommended,I like this game. But I will only give it a good review after some issues are addressed * map glitches. Basically I was stuck in the map and couldn't do any action killer couldn't hit me. The only thing to do is leave. Or just stick around until the killer gets bored and leaves.* last survivor camping. For those who don't know some as***** killers just chase / hit / drop the last remaining survivor until they quit. The killer gets points survivor gets 0 points at the end.* leaving the game gives you 0 points. Generally you will do that because you either glitched out or getting camped and it is just not your fault so why should the game punish you ???* server issues. Christ partying with friends is just almost impossible sometimes. You have to create the lobby 3 4 times until you manage to get into a game.* playing entirely only with friends does not give you points. People will abuse this sure but let's face it how much ? This game is not going to become an e sport so why take blood points so serious ? I still want to advance when playing with a killer friend and I promise you they will not go easy on me.,Dead by Daylight,1,38,1123,215,1

11/14/2018,0,0,561,Not Recommended,This is a great example of how game can just turn from best game ever to a Mostly I will talk about online mod but there is something I have to say about single payer too. Single player is just great really enjoyed it. Rockstar always made sick storys of their games max pain red dead redemption and all other series of gta. This one was even better. Graphics were good for that year that it came out. Gameplay is really good in single and online mode. But when you finish the snigle player you go to online. And here where the starts. I bought this game only for online I played single player after 300 hours of gameplay. First time gta online was good enjoyed it 100%. But then people just randomly started blowing you up. Not just doing it with RPG or some other explosive guns they were just hackers. I dont know if you get banned or no but in every session there were like at least 5 hackers. Some were just getting XP or money. Ok i dont care if people use hacks to get xp or money but when i drive and randomly die thats the thing i care about. After couple years rockstar didn do with that even I think now people just hack in sessions and rockstar dont do After some couple updates we saw some flying cars and bikes with missles. Ok my question is WTF? They made this game grinding all other updates are either some cool flying with rockets machine gun and you become god inside or grinding property like office moto club and bunker. Its all about grinding money to spend on some OP Its not fun anymore. But anyways i guess I enjoyed time that i spent on this game hope rockstar know what they are doing because i cant tell if they actually do.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,561,1653,317,1

2/14/2015,0,0,67,Recommended,Rust is a great game hands down. It manages to be relatively in depth in all aspects while also mainting a pretty simple and user friendly UI/crafting system. There is a variety of servers with different mods and such allowing for many different types of players to enjoy the game equally. I'm not going to go too far into detail on the gameplay though because it basically comes down to if you're the type of person who likes survival crafting games. If not steer clear if so I'd say this is a must have. The only reasonable downside is that there is no singleplayer but finding a friendly or low pop server isn't difficult.,Rust,3,67,625,114,3

10/22/2016,0,0,1416,Recommended,"IntroI've never seen such a decline in overall quality of a game. Every time I lauch this game I can't bring myself to play more than a few games before I get sick of it. If you asked me what I thought about this game 5 6 months ago I'd be ecstatic whilst explaining how much I loved it. I damn near hate this game now. There are so many problems the devs are too brain dead to fix and the game is so boring as well.Before I continue with this game I want you to know that I have played this game for about 2 and a half years from Ps4 to PC. I have over 1400 hours in total and have played/beaten grand champ and pro players alike. So in no way am I inexperienced. This review comes from a place of hope that the developers will fix the many problems in their game. I'm going to break this review down into catagories in which I think need the most attention. Than you for reading.Bans and SuspensionsThis is one that has affected me the most. I have over 4000 hours of ban time over all of my accounts. Yes I know I am at fault here. I broke their stated rules I accept that. My problem here is that the devs allow you to type profanity in the game chat but don't automatically censor these words. The devs don't just ban you for saying the words you have to be reported first. Players can choose to see the chat but can also get other players banned for simply speaking their mind using ""Extremely offensive"" text.Potential solutions Create a profanity filter than is on by default for new players. Reduce game bans to chat bans. Don't let players type swear words in chat in the first place.Server IssuesI don't think any other games has server issues as frequent as Rocket League. There is without fail an occurrence of D sync or rubber banding. This should not be the case in a game that so badly needs good servers. A ball has to be in the same place for every player on the field. If it's not then the players getting the issues are at a disadvantage. One example of a server issue is a thing the community likes to call ""Ghost hits."" This consists of a player going to hit the ball and seeming hitting the ball. But as you probably guessed the player didn't actually hit the ball. Everyone sees him hit the ball the ball goes in the direction of the ""hit"" for just a split second and snaps right back to where it was. This creates massive problems and has caused me and many others to lose when we shoudn't have. There is nothing more disappointing than playing a good game against other good players going into a long overtime and then losing to a ghost hit. At that point you are losing to the game not the players. Another example of a server issue is extreme lag off of kickoffs. The game will show you going for the ball then all of the sudden you're flying off in a random direction while you see the opponet slam the ball into your net. This is obviously more game breaking than a simpe ghost hit. It puts you out of the play entirely and there's nothing you can do to stop it from happening. You can't tell its going to happen it just does...randomly.Potential solutions Fix your broken servers for the love of god.Wow would you look at that. One simple easy solution...Bugs and GlitchesOh don't we all just love glitches. In any game glitches/bugs can be something to laugh at or something that makes you hate the game you play and wonder why you have it in the first place. I'm afraid that with Rocket League it's the latter. This game has too many bugs for me to mention. So I'll just talk about a select few.The first one that came to mind is when a wavedash will completely break. If you don't know what a wavedash is it's basically just landing on the ground and flipping into the ground to gain speed. Just from explaining what a wavedash is you can probably already guess what the bug is. When executing a wavedash the game will sometimes just put you through the ground and/or force you to front flip and lose all of your momentum. Extremely frustrating.The second and arguably the most infuriating is the boost pickup glitch. This one makes me mad beyond belief. As you can probably guess the boost will either not be picked up or someone else will get it that shouldn't have. It seems as if the distance to get the boost varies for no reason. To me it seems like RNG whether or not I get the boost. Another glitch with the boost is when you have 100 and the boost is still picked up. This isn't that big of a problem but still needs to be fixed. I have accidentally stolen boost from teammates as a result of this one.The third one to come to mind makes me wonder how it's even a thing. What I'm talking about is when you go to create a private match and it will change the server region for absolutely no reason. This is just annoying and I don't know how it's remained in the game for this long.Possible solutionsBug test your game?!?!?!I can't really give a solution to these cause I'm not a developer and I don't know what it takes to fix a glitch.OutroAt the end of the day I still recomend this game to newcomers it's not completely broken. Someone new could have a lot of fun making new experiences. But me? No I can't enjoy this game like I used to.I used to love this game but I just can't with all these big problems. Please fix your game Psyonix. Make me enjoy your game again. If I think of any more issues I will comeback and edit this review and add them accordingly. Thank you for taking the time to read this review (doubt anyone will get this far xd). Damien",Rocket League®,5,1416,5502,1043,5

The screenshots and ingame footage i was thinking a grimy world and epic battles with lots of blood. Instead it felt like the game is directed at 12yr old's with happy over the top colours. NEEDS MORE DARKNESS IM HUNTING MONSTERS.I did enjoy making my character tho really customizable with alot to changes.Im still not sure what the game is directed to be. A multiplayer co op monster hunting game? Cant be surely if you cant see your friends outside of quests? Why let us join a 16 slot server with randoms if you cant even see them (bar one location)? Its surposed to be MONSTER HUNTER yet ive got a scrawny cat next to me fighting dragons. 5/10 Dont buy this game expecting to enjoy it with friends. You'll most likely get a few hours of gameplay then realize how it is on pc and then your passed the hours of being able to refund it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,1,1240,236,1

Thoughts on being a killer Being a killer is frustrating at times and the survivor are just some toxic guys with improper behaviorsWhen i started Playing killer with only 1 perk i was being matched with 3 survivor friends with flashlight is fun indeed Kappa.And the post game chat can sometimes be kindda wild.Thoughts on playing a survivor When i played survivor there are just some toxic guys who dces everytime the killer downs them.And the teamates are kindda meh in low ranks someone saves me in front of a killer me getting hooked back effectively killing me. TLDR This Games is not new player friendly.Dont Play Survivor unless playing with friends.Dont Play Killer if you dont want to be bombarded by hateful comments. *I Can see why people do get toxic sometimes and it is the case for many games but devs please take action on these guys a warning or so is a good example.For the Devs Could you please buff the killer make a more balanced matchmaking and take more serious action toward toxic players to improve the community.,Dead by Daylight,3,75,1481,258,1

And when you have built a good base and got all the loot you desired theres no reason to still play. More examples is a ugly game with fps problems. The game looks ugly even on high settings and is full of lag. So just spend your 20 dollars on some good game for now.,Rust,1,63,358,75,3

1/20/2014,0,0,90,Recommended,This game makes you feel like you NEED to survive at all cost if you have a house already but if you're naked with a rock you won't mind dying so much that's why there's are alot of caveman like players running around trying to kill you. I'd say there's a 20% friendly and 80% SOS (shoot on sight) players in the game. It gets very frustating when you work so hard and then lose everything you worked for because of some who wanted your loot. For a survival game it is very fun the sound is very good game mechanics are a little wonky but it's in alpha so idc. I hear alot of people complaning about hackers but i've never encountered one so i think it depends on the server you are playing on. What i love the most about this game is the sounds it haves like footsteps gun shoots plane right above you behind you left and right everything. I've excaped some trouble some encounters just by running behind some rocks/mountains and just wait to hear their footsteps pass through and it feels so movie like it's amazing and very fun. 9/10 For a survival game IMO.,Rust,3,90,1061,201,3

The least the devs could do is allow for a 3 setting switch (Random Female Male) But no they force a random unchangeable appearance and gender on you.

Once that got fixed I was no longer able to find any SOS's. However now that the disconnection issues seemed to be fix I have to say it's a great game. I'm new to the Monster Hunter franchise and only got this game after getting hyped up by the console release. After several months of dreadful waiting it finally arrived.Pro's Fun to play with friends or solo Decent amount of different monsters and types 14 different weapons to try out Tons of armour for you and your cat Free DLC updates which add more monsters (Deviljho being the most recent for PC) Controller support Fishing Poogie Palico'sCon's Dc's Don't pick this up if you don't like grinding A lot of rng see above. No costume/layered armour so unless you're using mods you'll be looking a bit weird with all the different set combinations. Disappointing ""Final boss""I'll say once again that this is a very grindy game if you don't like grinding/rng consider something else since this game is mostly grinding.

12/24/2016,0,0,83,Recommended,After a while of not engaging in fun and enjoyable mulitplayer experiences I finally plucked up the courage to buy this wonderful piece of art. I actually played this game when it was on the 'Free to Play' weekend but then I never came back to it.First of all the game fundamentally replicates the theme of a football (soccer) match which initally sounded awful becuase I really don't like football...or any &lt enter body part&gt ball tbh. But I was so wrong. The standard mode of the game consists of a 3 vs 3 game where you attempt to score goals with a massive weird exploding ball. This is so competitive and fun to play and is more particularly enjoyable when accompanied by friends. We tend to get really in the spirit yelling at other players and eventually finishing with 'gg' regardless of the abusive shouted from both teams whether in text or voice chat. There's some good back and fourth banter going on when this happens (I cringed a bit writing that). Second of all the game consists of not just standard mode but also a RUMBLE MODE. This mode takes the game to a whole new level of enjoyment and laughter. Rumble is a mode which is constructed of the standard mode but then adds different power ups in which the player can uses to their advantage (and if you're me you'll manage to use them to your disadvantage). One of my favourite things about this game is the customisation of your car and the many MANY different flags and toppers that the player can earn after games. The game also includes different takes on different sports like hockey and basket ball but for me personally the fun is in waking one great massive ball at the back of the net.Overall I would reccomend this game if you and your friends are looking for a new game to play which is enjoyable funny and ADDICTING!,Rocket League®,3,83,1800,327,3

10/5/2015,0,0,1009,Recommended,"I liked the part when I got killed by kids with flying bikes 11/10Now on a more serious note. This game is filled with kids and tryhards. I don't really know what's worse in this game kids or people over 18 that act though on an online game. Both types are cancerous anyway but this didn't stop me from getting almost 1000 hours of playtime. The game is great it's an open world game where you can do lots of stuff but some people don't see past the flying bikes and weaponized vehicles so there's a lot of griefing. And here some people will say ""iT's A PvP gAmE dOnT pLaY iT iF YoU dOnT wAnNa DiE"". First of all it's not a PvP game it's much more than that. It's not ing fartnite or any of that t. Can you do PvP? Yes you can but that's not the issue. I enjoy a good fight. My issues are KD warriors tryhards and kids with flying bikes. If they kill you and you're not in the mood for a fight and you just walk away they'll be like ""hahahah noob i'm so much better than you because I killed you in this game and you can't kill me back ahahaha my life is so great"". If you fight back they'll go into passive because you'll hurt their precious and fragile KD. My issue is with people that say you're bad at the game because you don't have good KD. Like I'm really sorry for you if you think the KD is the most important thing. Making money is utter t you'll have to grind like you have no personal life and GTA is your wife and kids. You can join grinders groups where you can help each other making the work easier. I don't know how it really works with these groups cause I played solo most of the time or with randoms.I played this game so much because it showed that there are some good people somewhere. I met lots of great and amazing people in this game. That's the only reason I play this game to find great people. I met nicer people in this game than I did in real life. So it's pretty much self explanatory.It's a fun game to play with friends. Just ignore any tryhards and KD warriors.",Grand Theft Auto V,5,1009,1997,394,5

Anyways I experienced a glitch which prevented me from going online so I go and post a ticket asking for help and attach an error message and a video. But after posting said ticket asking for help months ago the only response that I was given was ""Try signing out and back in"" or ""Run it as administrator"". And at 5/5/2015 the game doesn't even work at all for me. The thing is my computer is running Windows 7 it meets the recommended build and it is frusterating that after such a long wait for this game to get on PC it is broken (for some (a lot) of us).As of 6/15/17 Rockstar has targeted single player mods and has started to become unethical.

9/12/2017,1,1,1000,Not Recommended,This is my first review for a game and im only reviewing this to let people know why you shouldnt buy this game. The game is fun. honestly I love how active the dev team is in updating and modifying the game. As you can see I've got nearly 1000 hours on the game and for good reason. There is one downfall to this game. And its easily the worst aspect of the game and a huge deal breaker for me. The community SUCKS. REALLY REALLY It filled with 13 15 year old racist sexist homophobic spolit little excuses for kids. It is an absolute rarity to actually be able to find someone who is nice and doesn't just kill you straight away. The amount of times I've been starting this game and have been relentlessly killed by people who are fulled gear with guns and I've had barely anything to even start a base with. If you're one of the s who doesn't give a about anyone else besides yourself then this game might work for you. But if youre anyone who isnt a white male I'd recommend going somewhere else unfortunately. Because this game will honestly make your skin crawl. I just wish that the dev team could do something about this and maybe enforce the age restriction on the game. Because without the younger kids playing this game it would be CONSIDERABLY better. In every single way.,Rust,1,1000,1284,240,1

8/13/2016,1,2,326,Recommended,Well... I bought the game on the weekend it came out and only played online for my first 165ish hours. I decided a couple days ago that I should probably play the story at some point and now that I had a computer that could run it better than when I first bought it I set in to the story of GTA V. The story was so great that I stayed up really late and got up early to play this game as if it was a novel I couldn't put down. After playing through the entire story I felt like I got the 60 dollars I dropped on this game over a year ago without thinking about all the fun I had had previously with friends in the online mode. I would 100% recommend this game for the story alone and online is an amazing bonus in my opinion. Let's see how long it takes me until restart the story just to play it a couple more times!,Grand Theft Auto V,5,326,817,169,5
7/18/2017,0,0,121,Not Recommended,The Creator of the game is a power tripping child. Throwing bans at some people while other people get away with breaking the rules. He focuses more on starting childish arguements on twitter with people who annoy him even when the other person has stopped replying and accepted it's pointless and childish he keeps going. All that aside I still don't reccomend the game. The second to second moments in the gunfights are so inconsistent. When you slow the footage down you see your ammo count go up and down while shooting. Sounds are all over the place. This game caters for coward tactic players and rewards them. The loot is so RNG to the point where you can search an entire house without finding a weapon but the person in the next house down is now fully kitted and coming for you. I have given the game more than a chance to see if I can adapt to it but the play style of the game is so sluggish and boring it is actually hard to have a good time on the game. If you like slower pace games where you basicly hide and wait it may be for you. But if you're after a fast paced action packed game save your money.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,121,1117,214,1

6/21/2018,0,0,887,Not Recommended,"All in all this game was something special in early access. The gameplay was buggy and the servers were trash (still aren't great even at the supposed ""60 tick"") but it was great. the game started going down hill the more it approached 1.0 with less optimization and more new content that also just created more optimization problems and bugs.As every month after 1.0 goes by this game seems to go out of its was to dump on its patrons with less and less game updates and more cosmetic t. This game has become the new CS GO of skin garbage and blatant cheating. Go play fortnite it's a cartoon game but at least your not paying for it and its had more updates in the past 2 months than PUBG has had this year. I feel like if you support this game you are one of the reasons why so many of these early access games make so much money only to end up as piles of garbage that the devs dont care about because they have already made a ridiculous amount of money off of them.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,887,970,188,1

9/9/2016,0,0,47,Recommended,Product received for free. Just going to keep it shortish and list the pros and cons of this game.ProsThe game play is good really enjoyed the base building and resource gathering. The mechanic for constructing a house or base it easy to use and very satisfying.Night time isn t as long as the day. It s a good thought as early on you re stumped in the dark so not waiting that long for sunrise keeps the game moving. You don t loose levels when you die. Unlike other games when you re dead you re dead Rust lets you keep all the items you ve unlocked. You just have to build them again and if you find your body (so long as that bear that killed you has wandered off) you can pick up your old items. Make sure you build a sleeping bag and place it in your house counts as a spawn point.ConsI understand why but not being able to edit parts of your house you ve placed is a real pain. Put a window in the wrong place? Reconsider a new addition to the pad? You re going to have to spend a lot of time and break a lot of tools to pull that wall down for your extension. Locking yourself out the house we ve all done it but normally a neighbour has a spare key not so much in Rust... Early on you rely on keys to your front door it stops other players stealing your items but if you loose that key (if you die for example) you re going to have to make a lot of axes to break your front door down. Later on you unlock a number keypad instead which solves this issue or if you insist on keys make a spare and hide it in a stash box in a place hidden but one you ll remember.Waking up. When loading into a server you get a little message press any key to wake up . This is as about responsive as a dead dog and it can take minutes of keyboard bashing to wake your guy up.Unable to pick who you are. The game assigns you a character based on your steam ID. It s not much of an issue as the game is 1st person so you don t see yourself that often. However not having any choice in what you look like is defiantly not a selling point of this game. Building decay. Again I know why but I think they need to lenghten the time it takes for buildings to decay. It's meant to free up servers but if you dont play every single day your building will start falling apart. I believe stone structures last 18 hours before they start loosing HP wood less than that and metal slightly longer. If you were to leave it a week between playing you would have lost everything even without taking the hostile players into account. Dont build anything worth keeping i guess unless you're playing every day. It's worth noting opening doors stops decay and resets the buildings timer. Maybe place an unlocked door outside so other players might acciedentally reset your timer while your not playing. The community is awful! The first few nights playing this game was peaceful. I played on a noob server and ended up building quite an impressive house/castle. However on the fifth night some players joined who just wanted to troll people. All evening was spent walking out the front door to be shot. House was burnt down and stuff stolen. They didn t let up either constantly harassing you even when all you had was empty pockets desperately trying to rebuild. Overall this game would be a fantastic single player but if you don t like call of duty kids rent a server with friends.Because of this I couldn't recommend it even when the game it's self is great. Other players are really the custodians of fun for this game and they don t allow it often enough.EDIT After playing on a frienldy server who kicks trolls it has become a game i would recommend despite the above. Moral of the story play with friends.,Rust,3,47,3681,706,3

1/11/2018,0,0,323,Not Recommended,TBH this game is fun even more fun when playing with your friends definitely not a P2W game (for now).But this game is poorly optimized even some very good PCs have to play in Very Low to Medium settings. Bluehole releases more skins and maps instead of optimizing the game.Chinese and hackers are everywhere. No matter which server you will play you will meet Chinese in your game. Bluehole sues Fortnite instead of improving hack detection and hack punishment.This game has a lot of bugs sometimes you hit your car in the rock its wheel stuck in it the car explodes. Sometimes you walk near the fenches you stuck in it and the only way to escape is tell your friends to kill you.I don't recommend this game because it's not worth $30 and the Bluehole never adjust the price even a bit lower in sale off seasons.

10/2/2017,0,0,38,Recommended,I figured after the recent spike in negative reviews I should include my own. recently PUBG has been hit with negative reviews from chinese players complaining about an AD running in the game and add which was not displayed anywhere else in the world. the reviews are coming from people playing on other servers with high ping intentionally and are not happy they are being served a resolution.The game itself is great for what it is 100 man free for all death match (unless in squads)there are a few bugs here and there as with most new games but the development team is still very much active at continuing to produce and improve this game. the community is very active and as of yet you will have no problems finding a match as I've never been in a queue more than 30 seconds.

2/11/2014,0,0,332,Recommended,great game. eventhought 90% of the online community is hackers/trollers don't let that get in the way. lately the hackers have gone way down and as for the trollers i would recomend playing on a PVE server first to get the feel. then you can just mow them down with your own guns. im not saying to join them and also just kill anyone on sight but if you watch the chat and their movements it's usually pretty obveous who is and isn't going to kill you. Infact now you die more from people just scared that you're going to kill them than just killing you 'cus they can. all in all this is already a great game but remember this is an ALPHA not even beta so most of what they have planned hasn't been added yet. on their trello (https //trello.com/b/lG8jtz6v/rust) they have had several things finished that aren't in the game yet such as hellecopters and my friend said online a hacker or server owner spawned a fully functioning car so hopefull that isn't far off. i would suggest watching some videos and if you don't like what you see then wait a month of two and check it out again,Rust,5,332,1084,204,5

7/18/2017,0,0,920,Recommended,"After 150 hours played I feel confident enough in my opinion of this game.Is it a perfect game? No it is not but as of right now it is the best existing game for the battle royale genre which much better netcode and gunplay core mechanics than H1Z1 and more depth than others. The gunplay is quite realistic the guns sound exactly as they should sound adjusts itself dynamically to the distance it has been fired from. The bullet drop takes a very important place in the game and is consistent along with a gun given effective range. The gunplay mechanics overall are pretty consistent avoiding the frustrations of a bug related loss.The gun variety is definitely there you will rarely end up with the same weaponry every game unless looting multiple bodies. This forces the player to adjust to the loot and is exactly what makes the charm of this game. In PUBG everything is about adapting to the situation the zone shrink cannot be predicted to an exact perimeter the loot cannot be predicted the outward movements of other players can be anticipated but not predicted. This whole makes for a unique and different experience every single game.The community is fairly great so far toxicity levels are low compared to most multiplayer pvp games I have played I have very rarely assisted to team killing even in random teams nobody will T Bag your body.While graphics and optimization are not at their best yet the gamer did make some major improvements over time with developpers being transparent about their work releasing weekly patch notes with bug fixes new features etc. Obviously for those looking for the best graphics and the best performance then this game is definitely not for you. Surround sound implementation is ""fine"" as of right now. While it may not be the best I have ever seen you are still able to tell roughly where a close enemy is moving from around you using surround sound as well as hear vehicules and shots from afar.Overall for it's price you are getting a lot of hours of gun it is only fair that I would recommend this game.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,920,2055,362,5

Personal I would recommend playing this games with friends. This is a good because it comes with a test server where you can view new incoming updates early such as vaults maps guns vehicles and combat. The only thing I don't like about this game is the movement. The jumping isn't controlled and the movement dosen't feel smooth. This game requires a good gaming computer/laptop due to it's amount of players and massive map it takes up a lot of fps and is hard to render.

Super annoying yet very common. Lobby gets buggy forcing the killer to open a new one due to one slot being buggy not letting the last player join. This happens im not joking easily in every third lobby.Ping indicator Its rigged in a way that shows a better ping after looking for a lobby for some time (datamined by the community just google it up)1996 matchmaking Playing with friends makes you manually invite them via steam overlay Lobby bug ? invite again. Killer dcs ? (what some killers tend to do since swf is absurdly overpowered compared to solo queue ing survivors) invite again. Want to play another game with the same ppl ? invite again.Games occasionally start with 3 players. Whenever someone dcs or gets desynced or just disconnects due to a bug the game starts instead of sending players back in the lobby or whatever at least 50% of the time the game recognized the missing players and the team of 3 only has to do 4 generators instead of 5.Cheating.. Cheating is this game is incredibly easy to perform and pretty common. A lot of communities share their strategies to deal with survivors the easy way. Due to the game being peer to peer the killer can easily influence player ping desync people or just manually disconnect other people. Just adding like 50 100 ping makes an incredibly difference is basically impossible to prove. why you might ask ?Ingame report function. its a joke. Its a lazy way of saying you we dont give a about cheaters and sandbaggers or people calling you names and threaten your lives in the post game chat. THE PLAYER has to record the game and send a video to the developers after finding out steam64 ID's of the participants and filling out a 3 sided web form. Also keep in mind this game has NO replay function so you have to activate shadowplay. The process of reporting someone is so arduous you basically give a after doing it once.""Famous"" streamers can and will get you banned if you offend them in any way.Balancing One killer is absurdly off the charts with the argumentation high skillcap rewards higher success what is incredibly stupid as none of the other killer rewards a ""higher level of play"". While all other killers have to play in a patter the Nurse can skip those like pallets vaults etc. This specific killer is also not very hard to learn even tho untalented people will tell you a different opinion. Playing gainst Nurse over Nurse over Nurse over Nurse over Nurse is just so boring.I really love this game and if you put time in it you can live with all these issues thats the reason im still playing on a daily base. I wish the devs wouldnt always do 2 steps back for every step forward.If you ask for an example how about the event that is going on by the time of (re )writing this review. You have to fill ""vials"" with event exclusive objects. The clue is the killer lobbies atm are buggy that means you have to wait 15 30 (in some cases people reported 45min) minutes for a game to start. As survivor once you filled all vials you just cant participate in the event anymore since you can loot the event objects your only chance to get some bonus points (bloodpoints is the currency you use to level up and earn items) is hoping for someone in your lobby to have not completed the event yet.",Dead by Daylight,1,1800,3940,705,1

Buyer beware if you decide to buy this game I recommend considering hard whether the price they ask could be spent on something else. Only buy this game if you have the $20 to burn (or wait for a sale like I did. Lessens the blow.) The game as it currently is can and almost certainly will change dramatically before it is ever released. And that is IF it ever leaves early access. 1.6 million copies sold $40+ million in revenue and the game is arguably worse shape than it was a year ago.,Rust,1,403,568,106,1

2/3/2019,0,0,54,Recommended,Excellent remake that accomplishes everything it sets out to do. Combines tension atmosphere puzzles navigation and action expertly. After 10 or so playthroughs of the game I can't recommend it enough. The police station area featured in the demo is the best part of the game where navigation item management and route planning are crucial on hardcore and even standard difficulty. I found both of the difficulty levels well balanced and well game tested (excluding adjusted I did not play that one). The rest is well polished and fun but the police station was a fantastic example of complex level design mixed with a cohesive and logical structure. The infinite ammo weapons are also fun to play with to have casual fun playthroughs but the requirement to get the 2 best ones are a bit extreme. Being a fan of the series I really like this game. Overall I highly recommend the game even if you are not a fan. It is now my favorite in the Resident evil series. It feels a lot more challenging than the majority of the games in the series as well (at least the ones from 4 onward).,RESIDENT EVIL 2 / BIOHAZARD RE:2,3,54,1081,194,3

Then came the multiplayer random disconnection can't even start a room without error being thrown first (my first attempt creating room from loading menu always fail only the second or later will work and not for long).

6/19/2018,0,0,406,Not Recommended,After 1.0 the game completely tanked. The in game purchases were completely unnecesary to the games longevity and functionality. They decided they just wanted more money at the expense of rewarding their faithful players. Still has a decent player base but honestly don't buy this. You shouldn't reward bad practice. They took what could've been amazing and decided to let it all go to Optimization is STILL questionable. Hackers are STILL in the game. Loot boxes are STILL being pumped out despite these problems. And the developers are STILL not adding anything to the game that makes players WANT to keep playing. As funny as the statement sounds the only reason to keep playing is if you're having fun with it. Power to you if that's the case. But frankly it seems awfully unfair to the many who have poured hours into this game and only be rewarded with a lootbox system that gives you a chance to PAY to open it.If you REALLY want to play this game sure buy it. But I would honestly and whole heartedly direct you to other alternatives. Yes even Fortnite. The game isn't bad to be honest. But it has bad practices which we shouldn't reward. Don't buy into these developers not until they get their act together.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,406,1217,215,1

It's kind of Minecraft meets CS GO only to result in a frustrating experience.The good Graphics are amazingLots of stuff to research/discoverHuge maps with points of interestsEvery footsteps you hear will make your heart race.The bad Community is only griefers.It would literally take you ages to search for the interesting items.You start with a rock and a torch everyone will kill you on sight and it takes ages to build something loosely secure.You can't rearrange your house (unless with C4 which can't be easily obtained).I wouldn't recommend this game because of the community at large It's kinda sad to literally spend days building something only to have it take it from you by griefers. Not only they will loot your stuff they will also emprison you in your own home leaving you with the only choice to commit suicide and respawn elsewhere starting from scratch...Makes you really reflect on what kind of sick f**ks are playing this game.You have to then spend countless hours to gather enough resources to get raided again.It's worse on community servers every now and them they will wipe the whole thing including all research that you discovered.

2/19/2016,0,0,99,Recommended,I owe you one possitive review 10/10A year later GTA5 is still the best sandbox game I've played (I would rank Elder Scroll the 2nd sorry Bethesda). I Just bought and finished Assassin's Creed Unity (the main story and multi episodes ignored the collectables). Well not intended to offend Ubisoft but Unity do reminds me of how good GTAV was especially talking of multiplayer experience.For those who haven't tried GTA series the price may be a little bit high but defintely worth it.,Grand Theft Auto V,3,99,484,83,3

Scoring a last gasp winner or conceding a heartbreaking own goal it's all part of what makes Rocket League great. Psyonix have a very active community and they re trying to engage with fans of the game in all sorts of ways.

8/31/2014,0,0,80,Not Recommended,I would recommend this game for people who play with friends often. In other words single player is a pain in the at the moment due to hackers and raiding clans. If you jump in with a friends you have the advantage of spending less time starting up. This can be a big help when dealing with the first and major problem (hackers using aimbots and speedhacks). The second problem can be easily fixed by either building a fort or getting a group of friends yourself. I can only recommend this game once they implement a very strong dectection software for these low life hackers.,Rust,1,80,576,105,1

12/28/2014,0,0,28,Recommended,Don't be fooled by my play time on Steam I've played a lot more than it says (I owned the physical copy for ages before registering the key here) and I can say it's pretty addicting.Like most simulators the game is based on a mundane task and obviously this is based on driving a truck. Not everyone's idea of a fun time I know but it really can become fun if you put your mind to it. Or rather don't. The reason I love ETS2 so much is that it's so great to just load up on a lazy day that I'm not in college and drive around for a bit. It lets me forget the stress of the real world and take up someone else's life and just relax. Put some tunes on the music player from your computer or listen to a nifty in game radio that covers a lot of stations even the more obscure ones like Real XS only available in Manchester if you're listening on FM.Unlike a lot of other simulators the presentation is absolutely spot on here. The graphics look excellent and there are plenty of options to fine tune your experience (even my decent PC has frame issues on the highest settings) but even on lower settings the graphics are better than the majority of simulation games out there. The mechanics are great too and the physics engine really makes you feel like you are driving a real life truck.I do have a couple of issues with the game. One is that the collisions aren't very good/realistic and there is no visible damage to the truck at all. However if you intend to play the game at all seriously (i.e. not purposefully crashing into everything all the time) this won't be an issue. The other is that every time there is an update (and that is a lot) my truck gets returned back to my main garage back in Manchester which is annoying seen as I've already explored the roads around that area (Great Britain). I feel it would be better if your truck was moved to the nearest city considering they're not too far away from each other.Aside from those couple of very small problems ETS2 delivers in every area. Graphics sound gameplay and general presentation are well above the rest when it comes to simulators.,Euro Truck Simulator 2,3,28,2103,394,3

This is what happens when terribad console ports come to PC (And if you thought THAT was bad wait until there's a live network to battle with).The options menu is completely worthless lacking even basic options (CAN I TURN OFF MOTION BLUR THANKS? I REALLY ENJOY THROWING UP FROM PLAYING A GAME). The networks are as hinted at already HORRIBLE. HORR I BLE. If you are hoping to play with friends lose the hope now and save yourself the heartache.Go buy drugs or something with the money that you would have spent on this game. It's more constructive of a use AND it gives you a tangible experience that could be positive. There's no hope of a positive experience here.

I played MHW on PS4 at release and enjoyed the hell out of it. I wouldn't say this game is 'easier' than previous MH titles they just removed a lot of the tedious BS from the game so that you can enjoy the meat of the game the hunting. They just lowered the skill floor so people could actually get into the game before getting murdered outright by delightul stunlock combos.To the Elephant in the room All the complaints are about a DRM (Denuvo) that's meaningless to performance and meaningless when the company using it isn't going to disappear tomorrow need to screw off. It's not like they're owned by EA or anything...Capcom isn't going to dissolve tomorrow and cause the game to be unplayable. Yeah always on DRM is a move but even Blizzard does it despite getting roasted alive by the community for it. Shockingly the connection problems are almost non existant when I'm hosting my own hunts. People join and stay connected just fine. While I won't say their netcode is perfect but certainly seems far more stable on a connection that can handle it.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,95,1170,210,3

I know it's early access but I'm really really sick of the lag and the RNG that goes into this game. Literal weeks of terrible loot and bad luck whenever I land in a town. Not to mention the gunplay can be really really terrible sometimes. Full shotgun blasts to someone right next to you can either completely miss or do t damage. The WORST part is the lag though. The network connections to this game are really ing terrible. I'm tired of seeing someone going back into cover and still dying. Up to half a second after I hid.Game development is actually getting worse. Instead of focusing on frustrating aspects (lack of torque in vehicles which basically makes you a sitting duck if you stop on a hill ing autoplacement into terrible region servers everytime you start the game etc) they're placing useless garbage into the game like weather effects and more guns. SERIOUSLY frustrating.It has been MONTHS and we STILL cannot actually cancel an attempted join to a match. Even if you quit and reload your game you'll still be placed in the server you queued for more likely than not. &gt Land in a named town&gt Find just a pistol&gt Get run down by a dude with a SCAR L &gt Die&gt Land in another named town&gt Find nothing&gt Get run up on by a dude with a UMP&gt Die&gt Land in a named town&gt Find fantastic loot (scar kar98)&gt Circle spawns on other side of map&gt Find no vehicle&gt Run to circle&gt Immedeatly get domed by a sniper who just happened to be waiting there&gt Land in middle of no where&gt Find OK loot&gt Circle spawns on other side of map again&gt Spend entire game trying to make it to the circle&gt Get down to last 10 people&gt Die to someone with a groza,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,100,1774,324,1

The only way you can actually have fun is to find a modder who gives out money or mod your own game in online. But of course having fun isnt allowed at Rockstar so you get banned even though you just give yourself some money and dont mess with people. I'd even go as far as to say that i was helping more people while hacking. Rockstar just sucks and is money hungry as . So i wouldnt recommend this unless you wanna spend hundreds of hours driving back and forth from building to building getting killed by other hackers and rich kids with their mom's credit card.Note Its also pretty dumb you cant even appeal after getting bannedEdit User Yotter is a hacker he spawns money I recommend banning him if you read this.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,192,836,160,1

Bunch of weapons I get that people cry about weapon balance but hey you can't just give everyone the same loot and then tell 'em to go kill each other (you have War Mode there for that ) ) because that would be boring! 2+1 maps (Sanhok will be coming out this month i think) Custom games will be available for everyone later this year Fun especially with friends but you can even play with some rando from japan or the UK I just don't get why do people want the weapon balance. The point of the BR genre is to get better loot as you change locations and not to get the same loot and the same gun over and over and over again. Weapon balance is good as it is right now. The AWM is far superior to the Kar98K that's why it's in the Supply drop. People don't like this game because they say it doesn't require skill. Well that's one hell of a big in' mistake right there! You can give a player who haven't played a single match in PUBG a Groza with an RDS and a suppressor and EXT.Quickdraw mag + an AWM 15x he will still have no clue how to use them because the Groza has quite a little recoil and all the weapons have bullet drop that's where the AWM comes in he won't know the bullet drop he won't know the recoil pattern he won't know the muzzle velocity. THIS GAME DOES REQUIRE SKILLJust look at shroud or grimmz or ibiza or ETC.Even if they join a fight with the worst pistol in the game against a normal player with an m416 they will win 'cause they know how to use the guns.If they would make the weapons the same just in the name of ""balance"" the game would be boring.I get that people get mad because they died because of a bug but just relax for 30 mins then try again.I know that 30 is a little bit too much for this game since Fortnite is f2p but be serious please.At least 60% of the fortnite players spend more than 30 on fortnite emotes or skins or whatever.That's all i wanted to say.Thank you for listening and go ahead and PLAY PUBG!",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,5,271,2394,472,5

1/22/2017,19,138,42,Not Recommended,Rust is a game that I will not be recommending because of how hostile the game is toward players who aren't in groups. Rust is a game where you will spend hours gathering resources to slowly build a wooden house only for a six man squad to tear everything down in a heart beat. Now I understand that the nature of these games is cruel but Rust seems to have certain crafting aspects that makes the game easy for groups and almost impossible for lone players.I could go into excruciating detail but all I'm going to say is. Grouped up players can pop up large bases with ease because there's multiple of them gathering and defending lone players will spend hours building a basic wooden shed which is ridiculously easy to smash down. Building wooden things in this game is pointless because of how easy it is to break for a group building a stone house with a metal door is easy but for a lone player building a stone house with a metal door takes an extremely long time and there's a very good chance that a kill on sight 12 year old will blast you away before you complete anything.If you plan to play this game alone stay far far away from it.,Rust,2,42,1145,215,3

It has many many tons of contents and what i mean tons is literally TONS you can do heists small jobs run your own companies motorcycle club clubhouse etc. You car guys may even fall in love with this game and spent lots of time creating your own dream garage in this virtual game. Do you ever want to be a boss with your own bodyguards and skycrapers and multi level garage? This game got it for you. Do you want a high tech facility for your own biddings? This game got it for you. Do you just want to enjoy a beautiful scenery with your friends? This game got it for you.But sadly most of them are behind a big paywall. And yes i am familiar with grinding so i am quite okay with it. But this game has the level of grinding which for most people is unbearable. Thus forcing you to buy the so called ""Shark Cards"" or in other word microtransaction. Yes a pay to play game with freetoplay elements. Which is a recipe for disaster. Even it's a grind but with all these heists and other stuff it must be atleast enjoyable right? ....No. A big gigantic NO. You will spent maybe half of your playtime staring at loading screens. And if that wasn't bad enough connections are kind of garbage in this current state which is Peer to Peer. AND if these wasn't bad enough there are lots of hackers griefers and just overall bad people. Just like almost every popular games out there GTA V has a very bad community.It's a great game. It is. But the executions are just...horrible. I can't stress you enough that it's such a shame on how this game became to be as it is right now.In my opinion full price is an absolute No absolutely No No NO. Buy it atleast while it's on discount you can play singleplayer and mod the hell out of it when the story's finished. But stay out of online if you don't have other friends playing this game. It can be tons of fun with your friends even with the cons i've said above. But if you insist to play online on your own just expect a huge amount of frustration.",Grand Theft Auto V,1,297,2063,395,1

And Player PVP is laggy as . On all sessions.. People blip and teleport all over the place. You shot a guy 100 times and he take 0 dmg.. He insta kill you... Either everyone uses some kind of cheat or glitch or the game litterly is one of the laggy's game i ever played.. But It has allot of fun things and SP is still fully 100% funcitonal.. And with first person it's awesome. Heist are cool but to many problems with them. you earn very little cash from them If anyone DC or leaves all is for nothing and the session is disbanded compeltly. And much else.. So they ain't living up to what they should be..For a game that's been out for almost 2 years.. It feels like a Ubisoft watchdog cash in where they just ported a shity console version..

1/1/2016,0,0,3,Recommended,Rocket League is the third installment in Nickelodeon's hit series Rocket Power. The kids having been in a fatal accident and being amputees they pursue the only reasonably radical sport they can soccer with cars. The players are divided into two teams bodacious blue and osogood orange and together players fight over big balls. The game is quite good but however sometimes it becomes a bit frustrating when you don't get the gnarly score you thought you'd get because of some whack attack physics. If you're like me and you don't wanna fool cuz you're cool I'd reccomend that you shred on this game with a homie g. This game is meant to be enjoyed with a ploy for friends to the end ya dig.

It runs well plays well and most bugs have been worked out. However if you want to get this for the multiplayer look elsewhere. R* didn't have a problem banning people for FOV fixes but even now months after release there are still true hackers ruining the game for others. You can't kill them. Not to mention that even during peak times you get grouped into lobbies with 5 10 people. RediculousAnd now with what is probably the worst sales tactic I've ever seen. They bring the game to sale for 30$ for 2 hours. Those lucky to spam refresh on the store page got a great deal. Everybody else is getting royally shafted. The base game as well as a 5+ year old game that's normally on sale for less than 10$ and a 20$ in game cash card are now bundled together for the Low LOW price of.... 59.99 The same it was BEFORE it went on sale.So if you want to pay a premium for an old game the base game which is almost 2 years old mind you and i'm guessing less than 500k Multiplayer money then go buy this game. you Rockstar,Grand Theft Auto V,1,199,1135,222,1

2/11/2017,0,0,1564,Recommended,My all time personal favourite game by far! I bought the game over 2 years ago now and at first I didnt play it much as it was rather confusing to me and a bit of a steep learning curve. So I didnt play it for a good 6 months until I started watching a Youtuber called Phaedo 82 ... His raid cams and update videos gave me a whole new purspective on the game and from there Rust grew on me. Ever since I have played hundreds of servers and met hundreds of people which has been great! A few months ago I decided to help out the community by designing skins for the game I do it for fun and am fueled by all the support I have recieved doing so one of my workshop items has over 13 000 up votes thats insane! If you would like to see my workshop click HERE ... Overall Rust is a very fun game which is changing all the time due to the WEEKLY UPDATES playrust.com from the amazing development team at Facepunch. This is a game that I see a huge potential in!,Rust,5,1564,956,194,5

9/25/2015,0,0,189,Not Recommended,Rust is a survival game in which you must gather resources and craft items in order to survive. But sadly there is an element of human interaction which can be both friendly or hostile. You will soon find that everyone is HOSTILE. I do not know why but other players rarely if ever show reciprocity. It is quite demeaning to spend 2 hours building a base and crafting for it to just get destroyed by rage kids with rocket launchers. This game has a nice concept despite its good intentions other players are a large error factor which ruins a good game. I am displeased at best by this game it runs terribly on a GTX980 with a lot of frame dips. After doing some research I found that it is poorly optimised for most newer systems. So if you have a 980 970 780 770 you will not be able to run this game as smoothly as you should. I am very disappointed by this game it is a good game but the players are the most unlikeable holes you will ever encounter. Most players kill other players just because they are unable to defend themselves. I can only imagine those trigger happy players and anti social sociopath with little empathy and respect for others work and effort. I do not blame the developer for the players but I blame him (the developer) for the poor optimization. To summarise This game runs poorly on $1895 PC's The players are malevolent vindictive bullies with no respect for others Its overpriced and over rated. It makes my blood boil with rage. DO NOT BUY UNLESS YOU WISH TO GET ANNOYED BY ARROGANT SOCIO PATHS.

8/15/2018,0,0,107,Recommended,The game is great in my opinion best monster hunter out yet The online is reported to be spotty(haven't tried it too much but there has been many complaints to the point they took it off on Tencent) Story can be done purely by yourself which is great (as far as I know but even then there's the SOS system if you ever run into trouble) People complain about how they didn't fix how to set up lobbies that it's a straight port and it is but I don't know what they were really expecting. It's the same as console when it comes down to it and that isn't that bad a thing So many options for graphics making it very easy for a not so great PC able to run it enough (at min specs it pretty much looks like an early ps3 game so it really isn't that bad. Veterns from 4U and Gen will be fine with it we played on a 3ds screen for hours on end after all) Controller support is great (Big picture mode lots of options) Keyboard is still viable if you're worried about how to set up a comfortable scheme just look at an Arekkz video my dude The game is just so much fun (but if you're new I'd reccomend to wait for the next patch but don't just disregard it because of these issues at launch Capcom stated that they're aware and will fix it),MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,4,107,1231,245,4
11/26/2017,0,0,65,Recommended,"Never expected this game to be a big deal as I got it as part of a random humble bundle where I was angling for another game. This game however was a total diamond in the rough and has been a lot of multiplayer fun!Not much to say that hasn't been said by other reviewers The core game mechanic is essentially hide and seek with the additional nerve wracking ""break your friend out of jail"" mechanic. Super fun. Even though its irritating to be camped by a killer there is game balance here from the fact that a team of good survivors should see whats going down and exploit this to make progress on their objective. I think its a fun trade off and makes for some interesting moments!The thing that has been sort of a disappointment and this is something I've given some thought to because its weird the toxic attitude in the lobby both before/after games really gets old after a while. After about 40+ hours of game play being subjected to the abusive language over and over again is just tedious... I know I'm here to play a 'murder' simulator but its always a little sad seeing the % of the population that feels OK with subjecting everybody else to the chat room equivalent of a truck stop bath room wall.

But Ill take that over not being able to play the game at all.This game has a ton of shortcomings but the biggest slap in the face of all of them is that they continue to work on and release paid DLC content before the game is anywhere close to done. The menu systems matchmaking and overall multiplayer experience of this game is absolutely atrocious. I have 20 something hours in this game but probably only have about 1.5 2 hours of gameplay inbetween all of the waiting screens and crashes.

6/27/2015,0,0,490,Recommended,Rust is a great game and I highly recomend it but it gets a few things wrong The survival factor of the game seems nonexesitant because the only time you ever worry about dying is when you log off because someone is going to murder you. It just needs to focus less on the PvP side of things and more PvE because not once have I died of thirst or hunger and usually the only time you die by something other than a player is if you drown or when you accidently run next to a wolf or bear which you barely see anyways but I know Facepunch won't let us down and I still really enjoy playing this game.8/10,Rust,5,490,601,120,5

4/20/2017,0,0,166,Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a lot of fun to play with friends. Playing it by yourself is a lot of fun too although I prefer playing with friends. The graphics are nice and although there are still quite a few bugs reappearing now and then they make this game somehow a lot more funnier. The developers invest a lot of time and energy to create new things and fix bugs. I don't quite like the community though. A lot of people seem to be spoiled by Triple A games and don't see the work that's behind the game. There's a lot of hate and misbehaving trolling people who can sometimes destroy your game experience. Nevertheless I really like playing it every now and then because every game is different and even players with less experience can turn out to be real talents and make your game quite hard.I would recommend it if you don't expect everything to be fixed in a few minutes. I remember times where you waited for an hour to join a game with friends. Now it's much better. So there is progress and that's all that matters.,Dead by Daylight,4,166,1021,191,4
11/2/2015,0,0,661,Not Recommended,Why the negative review ? Some will say it's because i'm raging over this game. It's part true because this is the game the most frustrative game i've played this year and by frustrating i don't mean the positive sense.If i play on an unranked 1v1 game i win right off the bat. Then if i start a ranked 1v1 game it should be if not easy kind of challenging. But no i find me against with people who do aerials to goal and other stuff rather hard for my level. So yeah i'd say it's okay if you have the starting 50 points. But when you're found with 0 points with a dude who keeps doing aerial against you.I won't go over the ping issues as they are issued in the other review.I know this review will have many poeple not in agreement with me and won't be on the helpful tab. But remember that if you really want to have fun don't play on ranked alone if you're not ready and be sure to have a friend because this game feel hollow without friends.,Rocket League®,1,661,946,186,1

8/8/2017,0,0,98,Not Recommended,"So let's be honest and straight forward Don't buy this game until the situation has improved.The core gameplay idea is nothing too new considering it's been taken from other games in the first place and lots of similar games are popping up all over the videogame landscape at the moment but that's how the business is at the moment nothing new nothing we consider bad anymore anyway. While PUBG brings some interrestings concepts together and was fun to play for as long as it lasted the negative arguments against the game outrunned the positive ones rather quickly. It didn't matter if we ended the round top 10 or top 50 frustration was all that was left after each and every game.Why? For several reasons. I've shortened the list to the most severe aspects for a good start Don't expect to be good at this game if you don't have a very good aim. You either have to step up to the skills of others very quickly or you will end up as canon fooder in literally every round. For at least that's one aspect I like Aiming helps you step up to the better loot of your enemies and with a good shot even an inferior situation can potentially be turned into a win. The map is brutally underdeveloped. While it at least doesn't feel too generated it has been put together with little to no effort feels absolutely loveless in design and when you come across a stone wall that floats more than 30 centimeters above ground you can even see the lack of effort that has been put into the map. But luckily the devs are up to the challenge and will bring up even more unpolished and unfinished maps. Sad to mention that these issues could be fixed in a week or maximum two weeks of map design if someone really wanted to. Just aim for the head. Going for a solid body shot has literally no value in this game. If you waste 29 of 30 bullets for one headshot you will win nontheless. Worried about missing your shots cause your enemy hits you in your belly while you aim for his head? No worries your character doesn't even flinch when being hit in the neck or arm your weapon stays steady in every situation for as long as you don't flinch yourself at least. Anyways a lucky headshot will always do more damage than 5 solid shots in the body always. And that's what makes this game so ridiculous. Not even does a single headshot (or two not that it matters as bullets seem to seek out for heads anyway) takes you out directly even if the enemy doesn't hit you in your head directly you have no chance of knowing where he is in more than half of the situations. Why you ask? Cause your character is painless! Remember? He doesn't flinch. Cause he doesn't know where the bullet hit him. And why? Cause the community thinks that 'hit markers' that point in the direction where your body hurts is 'casual' and makes the game 'too unrealistic'. While we're talking about realism. This game blantly tries to claim to be a realisitc battle simulator and while we better not talk about the concept of a giant energy wall that kills everything that is behint it slowly and painfully and that moves over the map in semi random circles (we'll get to that later) there are a lot of things that couldn't spit on the word ""realism"" more than a 'hit indicator' would do. Naming some of them No Stamina &gt Infinite Sprinting Infinite Jumping. No exhaustion &gt Aim steady even while jumping. No flinching &gt Cause no one cares about being shot anyway. 'Full' fuel tanks last for about 2 minutes &gt Feels like we're powering electric cars with fuel and wonder why they don't drive. Godzilla Footsteps &gt Cause everyone can hear you walking through five stone walls. Infinite revives in squad mode &gt cause headshots don't hurt that much if your buddy is around right? And many more features like that. The wall basically spoken this is a mechanism that aims to draw the players together. The circle randomly spawns when all players have landed and reduces its radius at intervals. Everyone that stays outside the circle will receive continous damage that increases each time the circle has reached its new position. Where does the circle spawn? That's absolutely random. Will there be a player perfectly in the circle waiting for you? You bet there wil be. While that is at least a situation you can be sure of you can't be of the actual circle position. At least 50% of the time you will find yourself at the most distant point possible of the circle and you will be constantly running for 10 minutes straight in order not to die to the stupid wall that is most of the time faster than you can run anyway. So if you have no vehicle (which spawn so rarely that you can consider yourself lucky if you find one but ironically won't stop spawning once you have one) you're as good as dead anyway unless you have a ton of medkits with you. Loot Is Deal with it. Loot boxes Lets not talk about the concept of an early access title with real world loot boxes trying to get a glimpse on what market counter strike owns there and what money values flow around there. It's just a cheap attept to make even more money than they already do by selling copies of the game. Blantly spoken the 'cost for their gamescom tournament' is just a cheap excuse. Cheaters Tons of. Starting with anti recoil macros for logitech mices which are capable of nullifying your recoil for every assault rifle and submachine gun (and are ironically not banned from usage) over people simply deleting textures to see transparency instead of black textures (and therefore can just strip the game of grass and brushes and the like) and stuff like player outlining names of drops and players showing all over the map etc. etc. Horrible. Oh... and did I mention that you have to turn 'foilage' down to not think you're hiding in knee tall grass while everyone else can clearly see you resting on a plain dirt texture? The client bugs out 9/10 times preventing you from queueing up opening loot boxes changing your loadout seeing your stats and at least one crash in 2 play hours.While it would be generally okay that there's still a lot left to work on considering this game claims to still be early access and tons of client bugs substantiate that claim very strongly the devs are just pumping in content and ignore the most urgent and most annoying bugs and circumstances that would need treatment as soon as possible. But lets be honest with ourselfes as long as developers keep pumping 'new content for free' we don't even ask about such fixes anyway right? Cause they're doing 'so much for us already'. So we kinda create that mischief ourselfes. I'd say give this game a year or two until it is polished up and ready to hit the shelves but until then the hype will be over anyway and people will have moved on to a different game. So buy it if you're willing to jump the hype train and throw money out of the window but don't expect it to be worth it.",PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,1,98,6894,1257,1

9/9/2016,0,0,773,Recommended,I remember the first time I played rust with my friend I saw this huge base on a low pop server that was auto boost (my friend had taught me the basics before) and I went in (the server wiped like 5 hrs before I got on.) There were a clan of literally 10 peeps on a server pop with about 20 25 ppl. They had over 100 c4 about 7 m249's (idfk how but they did) and my friend knew how much gear this was and I had no clue. Just as I was leaving a smaller but more deadly clan came along and I had a full inv of c4 guns armour and mats they insta killed me with their guns and m249's. I went back like 5 times and got destroyed every single time. I got so salty but that's when I realized that I will love this game. 9/11 best game,Rust,5,773,727,155,5

6/26/2016,0,0,33,Not Recommended,Dead by Daylight is a great idea but this game is poorly balanced as of writing this review. The matchmaking is poor. People can leave when ever they want with no consequences. You can not be a lobby with friends unless you the friend are lucky enough to get into a lobby with them the only way to be in a match with them is to create a private match. Because of this people lobby hop a lot and its very annoying. How the servers are set up. They are Peer to Peer servers which means that a player is hosting the server and that can cause poor connections. My main issue is balancing between the survivors and killer. The survivors can get really overpowered perks and the killer does not but that really does not matter when it is literately impossible to get away from the killer unless you have a flashlight a board to block him or if you are lucky a window to jump through but that is extremely slow but other then that you can not out run him at all no matter what you do. A killer you can choose from is called the wraith and he can become invisable and he can barely be seen with only a bell toll to tell if hes cloaking or uncloaking which is very broken because if he put someone on a hook and cloak and uncloak repeatedly and that makes it impossible for anyone to unhook the person. The killer has a attack range much larger then he should and can hit you much farther then he should and he can hit you through a window when you are not even close to the window. This game is a mess of bugs as well for the survivors and killer. The developers have not updated the game to fix issues like these for sometime which is a disappointment. Unless the developers fix these bugs and issues and it is well known that they are fixed. I would not recommend this game.,Dead by Daylight,1,33,1768,343,1

1/25/2019,0,0,13,Recommended,If you are a fan of the franchise you already know what this game is about. I wasn't till this one so I will write my review as a person who have played a Monster Hunter game for the first time.TL DR If you are an MMORPG lover who also enjoy raids with friends or grinding and leveling up your character and kill endless bosses and mobs alone this game is for you (I highly recommend playing multiplayer though) The game basically is boss fight after boss fight in every quest enemy variations are great and combat mechanics are not simple to learn yet not impossible and you'll definitely have fun while doing so. Though I'd say don't expect a mind blowing story cause you won't find it in this game the game is not about the story anyways. It's about hunting monsters and it does what it supposed to do very well.Graphics are good but I should warn you though you definitely need a good PC otherwise you won't get a good framerate or you'll end up playing the game with potato graphics cause even though the graphics are great and smooth in most occasions it's not really that succesfully optimized for older systems so even medium graphic settings looks very bad.Audio is nice and fitting soundtrack does work very well with the game which is all I need from a game soundtrack anyways. (Though when a game has a soundtrack that can be considered a masterpiece I never complain obviously)I played it with both controller and keyboard and since this game heavily depends on weapon (of your choice there is a good weapon selection in game which is a plus) combos I'd say it's way better and comfortable with a controller. But that doesn't necessarily mean that it was badly optimized for keyboard users it's doable. It's up to your preferences I guess.And last of all grinding is a real thing in this game you'll end up grinding for supplies killing endless amount of monsters and if you find grinding in games intolerable you'd end up hating this be aware of this before you buy it.TL DR ended ) Over all I really enjoy this game it's challenging it's fun and it's well worth it's price.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,3,13,2088,378,3

1/4/2019,0,0,32,Recommended,PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds is currently the largest battle royale on Steam. I first played this game when it just came out and was still in beta. Back then it was a buggy mess and it still is but I have seen lots of improvement for peformance. This game is not easy to run and I do not recommend playing this on a low end computer. The weather is pretty loud honestly but it doesn't bother me that much. PUBG is also very slow paced and not everyone is a fan of that. Controls feel fine in my opinion and the shooting is also great. I hope to see improvements to the game in the future. I rate PUBG a 6/10.,PLAYERUNKNOWN'S BATTLEGROUNDS,3,32,609,119,3

It's swarming with hackers/cheaters with aimbots infinite health and other fun shenanigans to annoy and grief you. Rockstar is not doing anything about them or at least I don't notice it in any way and even if they do there isn't even an option for us to report players for cheating you can just report them for insulting you and such.And now Take2 even went as far to send a cease and desist letter to the creators of openIV effectively making modding GTA in singleplayer illegal. So my recommendation if you have already played the singleplayer don't buy this game even if online wasn't swarming with hackers it has just become such a terribly slow grind to get new Cars Weapons and especially the items from the latest dlcs. All that just to entice you to buy shark cards...This is just my 2 cents on the issue it's a shame what has become of this game due to the publisher.Don't give them your money they don't deserve it.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,172,994,180,1

4/17/2016,4,13,135,Recommended,To start off this wonderful review id like to remind you to MAKE SURE YOURE LOGGED INTO THE CORRECT ROCKSTAR ACCOUNT IF YOURE TRANSFERRING FROM CONSOLE. Dont do what I did and have to restart my online character all over again.But to cut to the chase Grand Theft Auto 5 is a beautiful open world 3rd/1st person shooter filled with drugs dead hookers robbing granny's of their cars and even more dead hookers. GTA V is the next segment in the GTA franchise after GTA IV which could be called a great game by some but also could be called missed potential by others. But one thing is for sure if you're a GTA veteran or you're brand new to the series I absolutely believe that this game with be an instant favorite/top game in your steam library.GTA V takes place in the glamorous city of Los Santos (Los Angeles if you wanna be all realistic and a city full of life money dreams crushed dreams and happiness. you follow the story of a retired criminal a young repo driver wanting more in life than being bossed around and the psychotic yet loving and emotional CEO of Trevor Phillips Enterprises. Follow the odd trio as they make the city their and fill their pockets as they do so. GTA V introduces a new multiplayer experience with GTA Online where you create your own unique criminal and shed havok on the streets waters and the air of Los Santos with your friends all while being killed by a 12 year old that no lifed the game in a tank. Rise up the ranks in your crew and spend hours grinding missions for cash that you'll end up blowing out your in the click of a button.Pros Very well optimized Hours of fun gameplay Free add on updates oftenCons All I can think of is other players colored cars in Online.So what the hell are you still reading for? Buy the game god dammit!,Grand Theft Auto V,4,135,1780,332,4

9/30/2018,0,0,137,Not Recommended,The singleplayer game is good. Not better than GTA IV Story wise but in terms of gameplay it's great! Multiplayer is another story.It's fun if you have a group of friends to play with but if you join a random session full of strangers it can get quite cancerous. Half of the online session are littered with modders/hackers and Rockstar doesn't seem to give a damn about them You could just do a solo multiplayer session but where's the fun in that? The other half of the sessions have at least one tumour of a human with a hovering bike that keeps shooting missiles on you and ruining your fun.In conclusion if you have friends to play this game with go ahead. If not don't bother with this game.,Grand Theft Auto V,1,137,697,129,1

3/19/2017,0,0,53,Recommended,From PS4 experience and the current experience from PC i can give some sort of review for this game and hopefully you all will read onSimply put it's just football with a car instead and obviously the aim would be to score goals to win when the game first came out it was great for noobie people to play since everyone was round your play style and level so it got easier to get better at the game. fast foward a bit and now you have more smurfs than players (smurfs are people who make new accounts and loook like noobs but are really good at the game) if you want to be able to go on competitive and have no problem then you need some good amount of experience on the game before even trying to go compet.the amount of things you need to learn if you want to become a very good player is vast and can take hours to master depedning on what you want to learnwhen it comes to compet the community you will come across will talk and a lot of it one small mistake and you will get everyone on your team hating you the amount of talking on this simply game is amazing haha.up until recently you are now able to open crates by buying keys which gives you customizerable things for your cars or a new car if you get addicited to the game then you probably spend loads of cash on crates and all depending on luck you might get nothing or something really goodmy conclusion is that it is a very good game but if you want to become really good and get high up in the ranks in competitve then you need to put time and effort into the game or you will get no where in the game overall very addicting,Rocket League®,3,53,1589,313,3

Great to play to with friends and has plenty of options if you want to play with AI or even to practice getting used to the controls. I would definitely recommended playing with a controller as it is the only way to perform flying hits.Possiblly the best 14 I've paid for a game.

6/3/2018,0,0,354,Not Recommended,Ive waited a while so i could undestand the mechanis better before posting a review . Curently the game is set up for survivors favor killers cant make a mistake or the survivors run all over them and the killer has to wait for the survivor to make a mistake in order to achieve their goals . This is the general life and death survive or die aspect of the game .Bloodpoints wise i do beleive that the killer has the upperhand as they can gain bloodpoints far easier than the survivors which helps to offset the bully tactics that most matches ive played tend to have . So a killer can level easier and get new perks faster then most survivors and also spend alot longer time waiting for a game in que .All around its fairly ballenced the community is what will make or break the game in general . There is maybe 1 in 4 matches where at least one survivor if not more wont disconect this is becomming a issue . The more dc's the less bloodpoints for a killer overall and the harder the game becomes for the remaining survivors . I have also noticed alot of matches where people have admited to useing discord or other means to comunicate as a organized group of survivors . I am not sure exactly how this is done but it does give them a huge advantage over a single killerand takes away from the killers fun and ability . I have seen groups of randoms work in a pac and do a exellent job that is the way its meant to be played and i give them props for that .It is a very fun game when people actualy play it like its suposed to be . be warned though if you dominate as a killer expect to be flamed in the aftermatch and accused of cheating . Most survivors I have met dont beleive a killer can win with 2+kills without cheating which tells you a little about how the game is rigged survivabily wise against the killers .There are alot of great players there are alot of ... not so great players as well (im not talking about skill) so its a potluck . They are adding a new killer and survivor as well as more customizations soon . They do work hard at trying to keep the game balenced and fresh . With that said though people may take alot of what i said as being negative im just telling it how it is good or bad and i would still recomend it . Issues with the comunity is not the developers fault . After 3 more months of playing the game and seeing the state its in i had to change my review . The swf discord groups run rampant over the game now and most (not all) are highly toxic . Survivors complain about camping and tunneling in the forums 10 times a day killers complain about swf groups about the same . The developer just sits idely by offering half off sales to help replace lost players and a new killer/survivor every 3 months to generate intrest and more money as a solution to not balancing the game around their own decisions . the decisions im talking about is the swf groups and telling killer that camping and tunneling are valid playstyles . each side has their own complaints and rather try to solve the issues at hand they just say we are going to do something about it and then seems like they ignore it and hope it goes away on its own ...,Dead by Daylight,1,354,3166,614,1
5/13/2018,0,0,35,Recommended,I've heard of many people saying that hackers are around every corner in this game. So far i haven't seen anyone. I know that there are some hackers out there but some people just can't accept that some players are more skilled than them. If you haven't bought this game yet i can understand. Sometimes you do rage AF. But at the same time that's what makes this game so awesome. It's not a game where you win every round. It takes some skill to win. I'd say you should buy this. If you aren't a person who rages every minut then you'll like this game. Because of the fact that many people actualle put time into this i'd say you should buy it.

7/14/2017,0,0,183,Recommended,If you like survival games especially CO OP survival games than this game is for you but here are some pros and cons CONS You will be raided and you will lose everything The player base is pretty toxic most of the time You will be killed on sight by a majority of players Those cool buildings in the trailers you won't be building them they are too raidable By the timem you log into any server even on wipe days people will already have AK's The game CAN be very grindy to gather resources especially when you are just startingPROS The combat system is very well oriented it feels accomplishing to kill someone. This game has a very nice building system to it and with very few limitations other than stability. Hands down the best crafting system I've experienced in a survival game vanilla crafting times feel right not too long but not immediate either. The satisfying Boom you hear when you shoot rockets into another base to get their lifes work from chests is the most gratifying thing in the worldTL DR buy the game you can always refund it,Rust,4,183,1048,192,4

The click to 1st person from 3rd while aiming is great foir this battle royale style game.

6/12/2018,0,0,16,Not Recommended,Bluehole is going to run this game into the ground. Most of my hours on this game are on xbox and that version is mostly reguarded as a failure so I'm not talking about that right now. I had expected the pc version to be incredible compared to the xbox version but the countless bugs optimization issues lawsuit drama toxic playerbase and overall slow and boring solo expirience just make this game look like a pile of steaming garbage next to another battle royale game that I could be playing on pc. To translate how bad the optimization is on this game I get 60 fps with max settings and vsync on Realm Royale but on pubg at the absolute lowest settings with vsynce disabled I can't even hit 50. Not to mention the lotto gambling garbage that is the microtransactions. I don't mind microtransactions as a way of buisness but LOOTBOXES. I'm very dissapointed and would not reccomend anyone buy this game. Get Fortnite or Realm Royale or hell even that goofy Totally Acurate Battlegrounds game.

8/12/2018,0,0,81,Not Recommended,Though im sure its been said a thousand times ill circle jerk as well. The game is amazing the actual mechanics gameplay style and world building are superb and run flawlessy. The game is entirely playable solo and can be completed using any weapon of your choosing with 14 options being viable in every scenario which not a lot of games can boast about. Sure some weapons are going to be a lot easier to pick up and understand but the more advanced ones offer complex play styles that offer a wide range of abilities for you to take control of and look stylish while doing it. With all that being said this game shines when playing with friends or even randos the monster hunter series has always been about being a party of hunters who play off eachother's play styles to take down large and difficult beasts but Capcom has once again shown that they dont really put effort into their PC port. It seems to be entirely based on luck if you and your friends can hold a multiplayer session for longer than 5 minutes with me being able to play with only one of the four friends who bought this game and even then the multiplayer will just give out at random. It really holds back the game and nullifies a huge selling point of the series.Last but not least the graphics options are out of whack and either dont offer much customization or straight up tank your frame rate even if you operate on two 1080tis with 8700k i7. For the most part this can be fixed by turning off volumetric rendering so I wont be two negative on this front but I have heard people with lower specs cannot run the game at all on low.TL DR this game is a real achievement in the series and offers some of the tightest and most balanced monster hunter gameplay i have experienced but the constant network issues and lack of proper graphical options can easily drive away newer players to the series. I would totally recommend it if you dont mind catching on to the monster hunter series as a solo experience but keep in mind that this game really does need multiplayer to achieve its max potential.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,1,81,2070,382,1

9/15/2017,0,0,504,Not Recommended,Why is MLGA a good addon to use to block killers? What if you encounter a killer who is not laggy in the lobby but becomes extremely laggy in the game and you don't want to play against them again.. well you used to be able to block them using Make Lobbies Great Again so you would know if you connected to them in the lobby before the game even started but now the devs have blacklisted that feature so it is possible to become banned while using it. Giving a negative review until they make MLGA (Make Lobbies Great Again) not a bannable addon when it had been whitelisted for ages simply because they do not like people using the IP blocking feature that has been in the addon since it's inception. Now they don't want people using it because there were dumb people using it to block killers playing as The Nightmare Freddy and I can understand the author of the addon being P.O.'d that they're asking him to remove the IP blocking feature causing that feature to be bannable when it has been around forever.For those wondering MLGA lets you back up your saves because the devs couldn't fix that very game breaking bug in a timely fashion (and still have not for another month or so) and gave you a ping indicator against survivors or killers and let you favorite or block killers or survivors that were people you didn't want to play against or wanted to play with in the future.So if you want the devs to whitelist an addon again that was always whitelisted but can now get you banned then let your voice be heard please. IF Make Lobbies Great Again's full functionality is no longer bannable I will finally change my review of the game and all of it's DLC that I own to positive. I know the developers try their best and listen to the player base but this is something they should leave alone and let players use if they want. Not every survivor wants to play against a laggy killer across the world. This is rhetorical but how does the game require you to log into it's dedicated server to access the game but then have the killer host and if the killer is across the world in lagsville then you as the survivors suffer? And now without MLGA's blocking feature we have no way to combat this. The only thing we can do is maybe disconnect but that is a crappy move to do and it removes a lot of your rank anyway.Keeping my past review for archiving purposes when I bought the game in September 2017 until they allow the full features of MLGA to be used again Connection ErrorConnection ErrorConnection Error5 6 hours laterConnection ErrorConnection ErrorConnection ErrorDuring Free Weekend Friday Evening... Seriously? Dev's release DLC before fixing issues I rarely see in other games on Steam. I see they know it's an issue currently on Twitter but doesn't seem like they're working very fast to show their dedication to their own game.Played for 2 days straight almost and had a ton of fun. Then the game wanted to update in the middle of a free weekend to introduce Leatherface which is cool except the update wouldn't update and it broke my game. It took me a couple hours to realize that the only fix was to just uninstall and reinstall the game with the new update. Now it is saying Connection Error on the main loading menu even though I just played earlier today.. so now after checking online for no answer I am going to attempt to uninstall and reinstall AGAIN. Probably the buggiest game on Steam to play but when it does work it's a LOT of fun. Just wish the devs could get this stuff working properly.,Dead by Daylight,1,504,3520,644,1

9/13/2018,0,0,230,Recommended,Fantastic game. Coming from the Souls series I heard a ton from friends about how much I'd like the Monster Hunter series. However I'm not a big portable gamer so this was my first foray. Let me start by saying that this is not a Souls game the story atmosphere multiplayer and end game are nothing like Souls. However the combat weapon selection (really class selection) and gear/build diversity are absolutely top notch. You'll read people complaining about the combat or stun mechanics etc. don't pay any mind to that those are likely people who came in expecting a hack and slash and were put off when the first challenging fight clobbered them. I highly recommend this title.,MONSTER HUNTER: WORLD,5,230,680,118,5
